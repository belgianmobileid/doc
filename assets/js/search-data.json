    "content": "To protect the exchange of sensitive information and ensure the requested information gets issued to a legitimate application and not some other party, the OpenID Connect protocol uses JSON Web Token (JWT) which can be signed and/or encrypted. itsme® supports 3 cryptographic methods to perform the signing and encryption of JWTs : . | Public- and private-key key pair | secret key | secret key + Proof of Key for Code Exchange PKCE) security extension | . You will have to choose between one of these methods when registering your project. Public- and private-key method and JWKSet URI . This method uses linked public- and private-key pairs to encrypt and decrypt senders’ and recipients’ sensitive data. It is also known as public-key cryptography or public-key encryption. This method requires that each party exposes its public keys as a simple JWK Set document on a URI publicly accessible, and keep its private keys for itself. Using the jwks_uri key retrieve the URI for itsme® from the itsme® Discovery document, . Your public and private key can be generated using your own tool or via Yeoman. If using Yeoman, you need to install generator-itsme with NPM: . $ npm install -g yo generator-itsme . After installation, run the generator: . $ yo itsme . The Yeoman tool will generate two files, the jwks_private.json which MUST be stored securely in your system, and the jwks_public.json which needs to be exposed as a JWK Set on a URI publicly accessible and have the HTTPS scheme . Refer to this section for more information. Whatever the tool you are choosing to create your key pairs, don't forget to send your JWK Set URI by email to onboarding@itsme.be and itsme® will make sure to complete the configuration for you in no time! The algorithms – needed to sign and/or encrypt a JWT or to authenticate to our Token Endpoint – are listed in the itsme® Discovery document for more information. Secret key method . Secret key cryptography method uses the same secret key to encrypt and decrypt sensitive information. This approach is the inverse of public- and private-key encryption. This method requires the exchange of a static secret to be held by both the sender and the data receiver. The secret value will be provided by itsme® when registering your project. The algorithms – needed to sign and/or encrypt a JWT or to authenticate to our Token Endpoint – are listed in the itsme® Discovery document for more information. If you choose to go with the secret key method, you will be able to specify if the ID Token JWT needs to be signed with the an asymmetric algorithm (e.g. RS256) or with a symmetric algorithm (e.g. : HS256). When using the RS256 algorithm, our public keys will be needed to verify the signature. This information can be found in our itsme® Discovery document, using the key jwks_uri. PKCE-enhanced flow . When using the secret key cryptography method, itsme® also supports an extra security extension named Proof of Key for Code Exchange (PKCE). This additionnal layer of security is intended mitigate some Authorization Code Interception Attack. It implies adding a random string, named code_verifier, to your Authorization Request and then a SHA256 hash of that string, named code_challenge, to your Token Request. First, you create a code verifier for each Authorization Request, in the following manner : . var code_verifier = 'some-random-string' Should use the unreserved characters [A-Z] / [a-z] / [0-9] / \"-\" / \".\" / \"_\" / \"~\", with a minimum length of 43 characters and a maximum length of 128 characters. You then create a code challenge derived from the code verifier by using one of the following transformations on the code verifier : . const crypto = require('crypto') const base64url = require('base64url') var hash = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(code_verifier).digest(); var code_challenge = base64url.encode(hash) //code_verifier MUST be hashed using S256.You are permitted to use plain only if you cannot support S256 for some technical reason.

    "title": "Certificates and website security",
    "content": "itsme® requires https connections to guarantee security. With the https protocol, a web site operator obtains a certificate by applying to a certificate authority with a certificate signing request. The certificate request is an electronic document that contains the web site name, company information and the public key. The certificate provider signs the request, thus producing a public certificate. During web browsing, this public certificate is served to any web browser that connects to the web site and proves to the web browser that the provider believes it has issued a certificate to the owner of the web site. A certificate provider can opt to issue three types of certificates, each requiring its own degree of vetting rigor. In order of increasing rigor (and naturally, cost) they are: Domain Validation, Organization Validation and Extended Validation. The Domain Validation certificate doesn’t provide sufficient identity guarantees to itsme. So, only the Organization Validation and Extended Validation certificates are supported. For example, using the Let’s Encrypt open certificate authority is not suffcient because it only provide standard Domain Validation certificates. The chain of trust of these certificates need to be publicly accessible, meaning that our systems need to be able to access the root and the intermediate certificates. All itsme® API URL we publish use https. All requests to our endpoints MUST also use the SNI extension (refer to the RFC for more information) of the TLS protocol, that allows our servers to provide you with the correct certificate based on which endpoint you are querying.

The error responses . Things will sometimes go wrong. So, OpenID Connect defines a number of rules regarding the format of errors returned from our endpoints. Authorization Endpoint errors . If the request fails due to a missing, invalid, or mismatching redirection URI, or if the client identifier is missing or invalid,… the Authorization Endpoint will inform you of the error our itsme® sign-in page. If the User denies the access request or the User authentication fails, the Authorization Endpoint will inform you by adding the following parameters to the query component of the redirection URI using the application/x-www-form-urlencoded format : . | errorREQUIRED | A single ASCII error code. | invalid_request | The request is missing a required parameter, includes an invalid parameter value, includes a parameter more than once, or is otherwise malformed. | . | access_denied | The User or the Authorization Endpoint denied the request. | . | login_required | The Authorization Endpoint requires User authentication. This error MAY be returned when the prompt parameter value in the Authorization Request is none | . | interaction_required | The Authorization Endpoint requires User interaction of some form to proceed. This error MAY be returned when the prompt parameter value in the Authorization Request is none, but the Autorization Request cannot be completed without displaying a user interface for User interaction. | . | unsupported_request | The request contains a not supported parameter. | . | invalid_client_id | The request contains an invalid client_id. | . | invalid_redirect_uri | The request contains an invalid redirect URI. | . | unsupported_grant_type | Grant type not supported. | . | invalid_grant | Invalid grant. | . | invalid_scope | The requested scope is invalid, unknown, or malformed. | . | unsupported_display | Only page is supported. | . | unauthorized_client | Unknown or unspecified client_id. | . | unsupported_response_type | The Authorization Endpoint does not support obtaining an authorization code using this method. | . | invalid_request_object | The request parameter contains an invalid Request Object. | . | invalid_request_uri | The request_uri in the Authorization Request returns an error or contains invalid data. | . | invalid_request | Oauth2 parameters do not match Request object. | . | temporary_unavailable | The authorization server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overloading or maintenance of the server. | . | . | error_descriptionOPTIONAL | Human-readable text providing additional information, used to assist the developer in understanding the error that occurred. | . | state | The string value provided in the Authorization Request. You SHOULD validate that the value returned matches the one supplied. | . For example : . HTTP/1.1 302 Found Location: https://client.example.com/cb?error=access_denied&amp;state=xyz . Token Endpoint errors . If the request fails the Token Endpoint responds with an HTTP 400 (Bad Request) status code (unless specified otherwise) and includes the following parameters in the entity-body of the HTTP response using the application/json media type : . | errorREQUIRED | A single ASCII error code. | invalid_request | The request is missing a required parameter, includes an unsupported parameter value (other than grant type), repeats a parameter, includes multiple credentials, utilizes more than one mechanism for authenticating the client, or is otherwise malformed. | . | invalid_client | Client authentication failed (e.g., unknown client, no client authentication included, or unsupported authentication method). | . | invalid_grant | The provided authorization grant (e.g., authorization code, resource owner credentials) is invalid, expired or does not match the redirection URI used in the authorization request. | . | unauthorized_client | The authenticated client is not authorized to use this authorization grant type. | . | . | error_descriptionOPTIONAL | Human-readable text providing additional information, used to assist the developer in understanding the error that occurred. | . | state | The string value provided in the Authorization Request.

HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8 Cache-Control: no-store Pragma: no-cache { \"error\":\"invalid_request\" } . UserInfo Endpoint errors . When a request fails, the UserInfo Endpoint responds using the appropriate HTTP status code (typically, 400, 401, 403, or 405) and includes specific error codes in the response. | invalid_request | The request is missing a required parameter, includes an unsupported parameter or parameter value, repeats the same parameter, uses more than one method for including an access token, or is otherwise malformed. | . | invalid_token | The access token provided is expired, revoked, malformed, or invalid for other reasons. | . For example : . HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm=\"example\" . Revocation Endpoint errors . If the request fails the Revoke Endpoint responds with an HTTP 400 (Bad Request) status code and includes the fllowing parameters in the entity-body of the HTTP response using the application/json media type : . | errorREQUIRED | A single ASCII error code. | invalid_request | The request is missing a required parameter, includes an unsupported parameter value (other than grant type), repeats a parameter, includes multiple credentials, utilizes more than one mechanism for authenticating the client, or is otherwise malformed. | . | invalid_client | Client authentication failed (e.g., unknown client, no client authentication included, or unsupported authentication method). | . | invalid_grant | The provided authorization grant (e.g., authorization code, resource owner credentials) is invalid, expired or does not match the redirection URI used in the authorization request. | . | unauthorized_client | The authenticated client is not authorized to use this authorization grant type. | . | unsupported_token_type | itsme® does not support the revocation of the presented access token. | . | . | error_descriptionOPTIONAL | Human-readable text providing additional information, used to assist the developer in understanding the error that occurred. | . | state | The string value provided in the Authorization Request.

The sub claim is a string that uniquely identifies a given user account. The benefit of using a sub claim is that it will not change, even if other user attributes (email, phone number, etc) associated with that account are updated. If no user record is storing the sub claim value, then you should allow the user to associate his new or existing account to the sub. All these flows are depicted in the itsme® B2B portal.

This parameter value is generated during registration. | . | response_typeREQUIRED | This defines the processing flow to be used when forming the response. Because itsme® supports the Authorization Code Flow, this value MUST be code. | . | scopeREQUIRED | It allows your application to express the desired scope of the access request. Each scope returns a set of user attributes. The scopes an application should request depend on which user attributes your application needs. Once the user authorizes the requested scopes, his details are returned in an ID Token and are also available through the UserInfo Endpoint.All scope values must be space-separated.The basic (and required) scopes are openid and service.

The value of the address member is a JSON structure containing some or all of these members formatted street_address postal_code locality country | . | phoneOPTIONAL | Returns the phone claim, which contains the user's phone number, and phone_number_verified, which is a boolean indicating whether the phone number was verified by the user. | . | eidOPTIONAL | Returns the unique identification number of natural persons who are registered in Belgium, which consists of 11 digits of the form yy.mm.dd-xxx.cd (where yy.mm.dd is the birthdate of the person, xxx a sequential number - odd for males and even for females - and cd a check-digit), and the Belgian ID card number, which contains 12 digits in the form xxx-xxxxxxx-yy (the check-number yy is the remainder of the division of xxxxxxxxxx by 97). | . | . | redirect_uriREQUIRED | It is the URL to which users are redirected once the authentication is complete. The following restrictions apply to redirect URIs: The redirect URI MUST match the value preregistered during the registration. The redirect URI MUST begin with the scheme https (refer to this section for more information). There is an exception for localhost redirect URIs that are only permitted for development purposes, it’s not for use in production. The redirect URI is case-sensitive. Its case MUST match the case of the URL path of your running application. For example, if your application includes as part of its path .../abc/response-oidc, do not specify .../ABC/response-oidc in the redirect URI. Because the web browser treats paths as case-sensitive, cookies associated with .../abc/response-oidc MAY be excluded if redirected to the case-mismatched .../ABC/response-oidc URL. If relevant (in case you have a mobile app) make sure that your redirect URIs support the Universal links and App links mechanism. Functionally, it will allow you to have only one single link that will either open your desktop web application, your mobile app or your mobile site on the User’s device. Universal links and App links are standard web links (http://mydomain.com) that point to both a web page and a piece of content inside an app. When a Universal Link is opened, the app OS checks to see if any installed app is registered for that domain. If so, the app is launched immediately without ever loading the web page. If not, the web URL is loaded into the webbrowser. | . | stateStrongly RECOMMENDED | Specifies any string value that your application uses to maintain state between your Authorization Request and the Authorization Server's response. You can use this parameter for several purposes, such as directing the user to the correct resource in your application and mitigating cross-site request forgery. | . | nonceStrongly RECOMMENDED | A string value used to associate a session with an ID Token, and to mitigate replay attacks.

If set to touch, it SHOULD displays the itsme® sign-in page with a device that leverages a touch interface. If set to page, the itsme® sign-in UI SHOULD be consistent with a full page view of the User-Agent. If the display parameter is not specified, this is the default display mode. | . | acr_valuesOPTIONAL | Indicates the authentication method required to process the request, represented as a space-separated list of tag values, ordered by preference.Possible values : http://itsme.services/v2/claim/acr_basic http://itsme.services/v2/claim/acr_advancedNote : if these two values are provided only the most constraining authentication method will be applied, e.g. http://itsme.services/v2/claim/acr_advanced. | http://itsme.services/v2/claim/acr_basic | It lets the user to choose either fingerprint usage (if device is compatible) or itsme® code. If the acr_values parameter is not specified, this is the default authentication method. | . | http://itsme.services/v2/claim/acr_advanced | It forces the user to use his itsme® code. | . | . | claimsOPTIONAL | Requests specific user's details to be returned from the UserInfo Endpoint or in the ID Token. It is represented as a JSON object that could use as member {\"userinfo\":{...} - which content indicates which claims to return at the UserInfo Endpoint - or {\"id_token\":{...} - which indicates those to return at the ID Token -, together with indication whether the claim is voluntary (default) or essential.Note: to avoid the need of creating an additionnal request, itsme® recomends to create a JSON object using {\"id_token\":{...} as member.Possible user's details your application can request is listed below. | nameOPTIONAL | Returns user's full name in displayable form including all name parts, possibly including titles and suffixes. | . | given_nameOPTIONAL | Returns the given name(s) or first name(s) of the user.

This parameter value is generated during registration. | . | response_typeREQUIRED | This defines the processing flow to be used when forming the response. Because itsme® supports the Authorization Code Flow, this value MUST be code. | . | scopeREQUIRED | It allows your application to express the desired scope of the access request. Each scope returns a set of user attributes. The scopes an application should request depend on which user attributes your application needs. Once the user authorizes the requested scopes, his details are returned in an ID Token and are also available through the UserInfo Endpoint.All scope values must be space-separated.The basic (and required) scopes are openid and service. Beyond that, your application can ask for additional standard scopes values which map to sets of related claims are: profile email address phone eid | serviceREQUIRED | It indicates the itsme® service your application intends to use, e.g. service:TEST_code by replacing \"TEST_code\" with the service code generated during registration. | . | openidREQUIRED | It indicates that your application intends to use the OpenID Connect protocol to verify a user's identity by returning a sub claim which represents a unique identifier for the authenticated user. | . | profileOPTIONAL | Returns claims that represent basic profile information, specifically family_name, given_name, name, gender, locale, picture and birthdate. | . | emailOPTIONAL | Returns the email claim, which contains the user's email address, and email_verified, which is a boolean indicating whether the email address was verified by the user. | . | addressOPTIONAL | Returns the information about the user's postal address.

Its case MUST match the case of the URL path of your running application. For example, if your application includes as part of its path .../abc/response-oidc, do not specify .../ABC/response-oidc in the redirect URI. Because the web browser treats paths as case-sensitive, cookies associated with .../abc/response-oidc MAY be excluded if redirected to the case-mismatched .../ABC/response-oidc URL.

On the sign-up or sign-in page, Azure AD B2C presents a list of external identity providers the user can choose for sign-in. Once they select one of the external identity providers, itsme® for example, they’re redirected to the itsme® to complete the sign in process.

    "content": "To protect the exchange of sensitive information and ensure the requested information gets issued to a legitimate application and not some other party, the OpenID Connect protocol uses JSON Web Token (JWT) which can be signed and/or encrypted. itsme® supports 3 cryptographic methods to perform the signing and encryption of JWTs : . | Public- and private-key key pair | secret key | secret key + Proof of Key for Code Exchange PKCE) security extension | . You will have to choose between one of these methods when registering your project. Public- and private-key method and JWKSet URI . This method uses linked public- and private-key pairs to encrypt and decrypt senders’ and recipients’ sensitive data. It is also known as public-key cryptography or public-key encryption. This method requires that each party exposes its public keys as a simple JWK Set document on a URI publicly accessible, and keep its private keys for itself. Using the jwks_uri key retrieve the URI for itsme® from the itsme® Discovery document, . Your public and private key can be generated using your own tool or via Yeoman. If using Yeoman, you need to install generator-itsme with NPM: . $ npm install -g yo generator-itsme . After installation, run the generator: . $ yo itsme . The Yeoman tool will generate two files, the jwks_private.json which MUST be stored securely in your system, and the jwks_public.json which needs to be exposed as a JWK Set on a URI publicly accessible and have the HTTPS scheme . Refer to this section for more information. Whatever the tool you are choosing to create your key pairs, don't forget to send your JWK Set URI by email to onboarding@itsme.be and itsme® will make sure to complete the configuration for you in no time! The algorithms – needed to sign and/or encrypt a JWT or to authenticate to our Token Endpoint – are listed in the itsme® Discovery document for more information. Secret key method . Secret key cryptography method uses the same secret key to encrypt and decrypt sensitive information. This approach is the inverse of public- and private-key encryption. This method requires the exchange of a static secret to be held by both the sender and the data receiver. The secret value will be provided by itsme® when registering your project. The algorithms – needed to sign and/or encrypt a JWT or to authenticate to our Token Endpoint – are listed in the itsme® Discovery document for more information. If you choose to go with the secret key method, you will be able to specify if the ID Token JWT needs to be signed with the an asymmetric algorithm (e.g. RS256) or with a symmetric algorithm (e.g. : HS256). When using the RS256 algorithm, our public keys will be needed to verify the signature. This information can be found in our itsme® Discovery document, using the key jwks_uri. PKCE-enhanced flow . When using the secret key cryptography method, itsme® also supports an extra security extension named Proof of Key for Code Exchange (PKCE). This additionnal layer of security is intended mitigate some Authorization Code Interception Attack. It implies adding a random string, named code_verifier, to your Authorization Request and then a SHA256 hash of that string, named code_challenge, to your Token Request. First, you create a code verifier for each Authorization Request, in the following manner : . var code_verifier = 'some-random-string' Should use the unreserved characters [A-Z] / [a-z] / [0-9] / \"-\" / \".\" / \"_\" / \"~\", with a minimum length of 43 characters and a maximum length of 128 characters. You then create a code challenge derived from the code verifier by using one of the following transformations on the code verifier : . const crypto = require('crypto') const base64url = require('base64url') var hash = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(code_verifier).digest(); var code_challenge = base64url.encode(hash) //code_verifier MUST be hashed using S256.You are permitted to use plain only if you cannot support S256 for some technical reason.

    "content": "itsme® requires https connections to guarantee security. With the https protocol, a web site operator obtains a certificate by applying to a certificate authority with a certificate signing request. The certificate request is an electronic document that contains the web site name, company information and the public key. The certificate provider signs the request, thus producing a public certificate. During web browsing, this public certificate is served to any web browser that connects to the web site and proves to the web browser that the provider believes it has issued a certificate to the owner of the web site. A certificate provider can opt to issue three types of certificates, each requiring its own degree of vetting rigor. In order of increasing rigor (and naturally, cost) they are: Domain Validation, Organization Validation and Extended Validation. The Domain Validation certificate doesn’t provide sufficient identity guarantees to itsme. So, only the Organization Validation and Extended Validation certificates are supported. For example, using the Let’s Encrypt open certificate authority is not suffcient because it only provide standard Domain Validation certificates. The chain of trust of these certificates need to be publicly accessible, meaning that our systems need to be able to access the root and the intermediate certificates. All itsme® API URL we publish use https. All requests to our endpoints MUST also use the SNI extension (refer to the RFC for more information) of the TLS protocol, that allows our servers to provide you with the correct certificate based on which endpoint you are querying.

The error responses . Things will sometimes go wrong. So, OpenID Connect defines a number of rules regarding the format of errors returned from our endpoints. Authorization Endpoint errors . If the request fails due to a missing, invalid, or mismatching redirection URI, or if the client identifier is missing or invalid,… the Authorization Endpoint will inform you of the error our itsme® sign-in page. If the User denies the access request or the User authentication fails, the Authorization Endpoint will inform you by adding the following parameters to the query component of the redirection URI using the application/x-www-form-urlencoded format : . | errorREQUIRED | A single ASCII error code. | invalid_request | The request is missing a required parameter, includes an invalid parameter value, includes a parameter more than once, or is otherwise malformed. | . | access_denied | The User or the Authorization Endpoint denied the request. | . | login_required | The Authorization Endpoint requires User authentication. This error MAY be returned when the prompt parameter value in the Authorization Request is none | . | interaction_required | The Authorization Endpoint requires User interaction of some form to proceed. This error MAY be returned when the prompt parameter value in the Authorization Request is none, but the Autorization Request cannot be completed without displaying a user interface for User interaction. | . | unsupported_request | The request contains a not supported parameter. | . | invalid_client_id | The request contains an invalid client_id. | . | invalid_redirect_uri | The request contains an invalid redirect URI. | . | unsupported_grant_type | Grant type not supported. | . | invalid_grant | Invalid grant. | . | invalid_scope | The requested scope is invalid, unknown, or malformed. | . | unsupported_display | Only page is supported. | . | unauthorized_client | Unknown or unspecified client_id. | . | unsupported_response_type | The Authorization Endpoint does not support obtaining an authorization code using this method. | . | invalid_request_object | The request parameter contains an invalid Request Object. | . | invalid_request_uri | The request_uri in the Authorization Request returns an error or contains invalid data. | . | invalid_request | Oauth2 parameters do not match Request object. | . | temporary_unavailable | The authorization server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overloading or maintenance of the server. | . | . | error_descriptionOPTIONAL | Human-readable text providing additional information, used to assist the developer in understanding the error that occurred. | . | state | The string value provided in the Authorization Request. You SHOULD validate that the value returned matches the one supplied. | . For example : . HTTP/1.1 302 Found Location: https://client.example.com/cb?error=access_denied&amp;state=xyz . Token Endpoint errors . If the request fails the Token Endpoint responds with an HTTP 400 (Bad Request) status code (unless specified otherwise) and includes the following parameters in the entity-body of the HTTP response using the application/json media type : . | errorREQUIRED | A single ASCII error code. | invalid_request | The request is missing a required parameter, includes an unsupported parameter value (other than grant type), repeats a parameter, includes multiple credentials, utilizes more than one mechanism for authenticating the client, or is otherwise malformed. | . | invalid_client | Client authentication failed (e.g., unknown client, no client authentication included, or unsupported authentication method). | . | invalid_grant | The provided authorization grant (e.g., authorization code, resource owner credentials) is invalid, expired or does not match the redirection URI used in the authorization request. | . | unauthorized_client | The authenticated client is not authorized to use this authorization grant type. | . | . | error_descriptionOPTIONAL | Human-readable text providing additional information, used to assist the developer in understanding the error that occurred. | . | state | The string value provided in the Authorization Request.

When a request fails, the UserInfo Endpoint responds using the appropriate HTTP status code (typically, 400, 401, 403, or 405) and includes specific error codes in the response. | invalid_request | The request is missing a required parameter, includes an unsupported parameter or parameter value, repeats the same parameter, uses more than one method for including an access token, or is otherwise malformed. | . | invalid_token | The access token provided is expired, revoked, malformed, or invalid for other reasons. | . For example : . HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm=\"example\" . Revocation Endpoint errors .

By default, your application Server will use the subject identifier, or sub claim, in the ID Token to identify and verify a user account. The sub claim is a string that uniquely identifies a given user account. The benefit of using a sub claim is that it will not change, even if other user attributes (email, phone number, etc) associated with that account are updated. If no user record is storing the sub claim value, then you should allow the user to associate his new or existing account to the sub. All these flows are depicted in the itsme® B2B portal.

If the same user would opt to re-create an itsme® afterwards, he will need to re-bind his itsme® account with your application server, in the same way as for the initial binding. After successful re-binding you will need to overwrite the initial reference with the new sub claim value in your database. ",

Parameters . | client_idREQUIRED | It identifies your application. This parameter value is generated during registration. | . | response_typeREQUIRED | This defines the processing flow to be used when forming the response. Because itsme® supports the Authorization Code Flow, this value MUST be code. | . | scopeREQUIRED | It allows your application to express the desired scope of the access request. Each scope returns a set of user attributes. The scopes an application should request depend on which user attributes your application needs. Once the user authorizes the requested scopes, his details are returned in an ID Token and are also available through the UserInfo Endpoint.All scope values must be space-separated.The basic (and required) scopes are openid and service. Beyond that, your application can ask for additional standard scopes values which map to sets of related claims are: profile email address phone eid | serviceREQUIRED | It indicates the itsme® service your application intends to use, e.g. service:TEST_code by replacing \"TEST_code\" with the service code generated during registration. | . | openidREQUIRED | It indicates that your application intends to use the OpenID Connect protocol to verify a user's identity by returning a sub claim which represents a unique identifier for the authenticated user. | . | profileOPTIONAL | Returns claims that represent basic profile information, specifically family_name, given_name, name, gender, locale, picture and birthdate. | . | emailOPTIONAL | Returns the email claim, which contains the user's email address, and email_verified, which is a boolean indicating whether the email address was verified by the user. | . | addressOPTIONAL | Returns the information about the user's postal address. The value of the address member is a JSON structure containing some or all of these members formatted street_address postal_code locality country | . | phoneOPTIONAL | Returns the phone claim, which contains the user's phone number, and phone_number_verified, which is a boolean indicating whether the phone number was verified by the user. | . | eidOPTIONAL | Returns the unique identification number of natural persons who are registered in Belgium, which consists of 11 digits of the form yy.mm.dd-xxx.cd (where yy.mm.dd is the birthdate of the person, xxx a sequential number - odd for males and even for females - and cd a check-digit), and the Belgian ID card number, which contains 12 digits in the form xxx-xxxxxxx-yy (the check-number yy is the remainder of the division of xxxxxxxxxx by 97). | . | . | redirect_uriREQUIRED | It is the URL to which users are redirected once the authentication is complete. The following restrictions apply to redirect URIs: The redirect URI MUST match the value preregistered during the registration. The redirect URI MUST begin with the scheme https (refer to this section for more information). There is an exception for localhost redirect URIs that are only permitted for development purposes, it’s not for use in production. The redirect URI is case-sensitive. Its case MUST match the case of the URL path of your running application. For example, if your application includes as part of its path .../abc/response-oidc, do not specify .../ABC/response-oidc in the redirect URI. Because the web browser treats paths as case-sensitive, cookies associated with .../abc/response-oidc MAY be excluded if redirected to the case-mismatched .../ABC/response-oidc URL. If relevant (in case you have a mobile app) make sure that your redirect URIs support the Universal links and App links mechanism. Functionally, it will allow you to have only one single link that will either open your desktop web application, your mobile app or your mobile site on the User’s device. Universal links and App links are standard web links (http://mydomain.com) that point to both a web page and a piece of content inside an app. When a Universal Link is opened, the app OS checks to see if any installed app is registered for that domain. If so, the app is launched immediately without ever loading the web page. If not, the web URL is loaded into the webbrowser. | . | stateStrongly RECOMMENDED | Specifies any string value that your application uses to maintain state between your Authorization Request and the Authorization Server's response. You can use this parameter for several purposes, such as directing the user to the correct resource in your application and mitigating cross-site request forgery. | . | nonceStrongly RECOMMENDED | A string value used to associate a session with an ID Token, and to mitigate replay attacks.

    "content": "To protect the exchange of sensitive information and ensure the requested information gets issued to a legitimate application and not some other party, the OpenID Connect protocol uses JSON Web Token (JWT) which can be signed and/or encrypted. itsme® supports 3 cryptographic methods to perform the signing and encryption of JWTs : . | Public- and private-key key pair | secret key | secret key + Proof of Key for Code Exchange PKCE) security extension | . You will have to choose between one of these methods when registering your project. Public- and private-key method and JWKSet URI . This method uses linked public- and private-key pairs to encrypt and decrypt senders’ and recipients’ sensitive data. It is also known as public-key cryptography or public-key encryption. This method requires that each party exposes its public keys as a simple JWK Set document on a URI publicly accessible, and keep its private keys for itself. Using the jwks_uri key retrieve the URI for itsme® from the itsme® Discovery document, . Your public and private key can be generated using your own tool or via Yeoman. If using Yeoman, you need to install generator-itsme with NPM: . $ npm install -g yo generator-itsme . After installation, run the generator: . $ yo itsme . The Yeoman tool will generate two files, the jwks_private.json which MUST be stored securely in your system, and the jwks_public.json which needs to be exposed as a JWK Set on a URI publicly accessible and have the HTTPS scheme . Refer to this section for more information. Whatever the tool you are choosing to create your key pairs, don't forget to send your JWK Set URI by email to onboarding@itsme.be and itsme® will make sure to complete the configuration for you in no time! The algorithms – needed to sign and/or encrypt a JWT or to authenticate to our Token Endpoint – are listed in the itsme® Discovery document for more information. Secret key method . Secret key cryptography method uses the same secret key to encrypt and decrypt sensitive information. This approach is the inverse of public- and private-key encryption. This method requires the exchange of a static secret to be held by both the sender and the data receiver. The secret value will be provided by itsme® when registering your project. The algorithms – needed to sign and/or encrypt a JWT or to authenticate to our Token Endpoint – are listed in the itsme® Discovery document for more information. If you choose to go with the secret key method, you will be able to specify if the ID Token JWT needs to be signed with the an asymmetric algorithm (e.g. RS256) or with a symmetric algorithm (e.g. : HS256). When using the RS256 algorithm, our public keys will be needed to verify the signature. This information can be found in our itsme® Discovery document, using the key jwks_uri. PKCE-enhanced flow . When using the secret key cryptography method, itsme® also supports an extra security extension named Proof of Key for Code Exchange (PKCE). This additionnal layer of security is intended mitigate some Authorization Code Interception Attack. It implies adding a random string, named code_verifier, to your Authorization Request and then a SHA256 hash of that string, named code_challenge, to your Token Request. First, you create a code verifier for each Authorization Request, in the following manner : . var code_verifier = 'some-random-string' Should use the unreserved characters [A-Z] / [a-z] / [0-9] / \"-\" / \".\" / \"_\" / \"~\", with a minimum length of 43 characters and a maximum length of 128 characters. You then create a code challenge derived from the code verifier by using one of the following transformations on the code verifier : . const crypto = require('crypto') const base64url = require('base64url') var hash = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(code_verifier).digest(); var code_challenge = base64url.encode(hash) //code_verifier MUST be hashed using S256.You are permitted to use plain only if you cannot support S256 for some technical reason.

    "title": "Certificates and website security",
    "content": "itsme® requires https connections to guarantee security. With the https protocol, a web site operator obtains a certificate by applying to a certificate authority with a certificate signing request. The certificate request is an electronic document that contains the web site name, company information and the public key. The certificate provider signs the request, thus producing a public certificate. During web browsing, this public certificate is served to any web browser that connects to the web site and proves to the web browser that the provider believes it has issued a certificate to the owner of the web site. A certificate provider can opt to issue three types of certificates, each requiring its own degree of vetting rigor. In order of increasing rigor (and naturally, cost) they are: Domain Validation, Organization Validation and Extended Validation. The Domain Validation certificate doesn’t provide sufficient identity guarantees to itsme. So, only the Organization Validation and Extended Validation certificates are supported. For example, using the Let’s Encrypt open certificate authority is not suffcient because it only provide standard Domain Validation certificates. The chain of trust of these certificates need to be publicly accessible, meaning that our systems need to be able to access the root and the intermediate certificates. All itsme® API URL we publish use https. All requests to our endpoints MUST also use the SNI extension (refer to the RFC for more information) of the TLS protocol, that allows our servers to provide you with the correct certificate based on which endpoint you are querying.

    "content": "Mapping using sub claim . To sign in successfully in your web desktop, mobile web or mobile application, a given user must be mapped to a user account in your database. By default, your application Server will use the subject identifier, or sub claim, in the ID Token to identify and verify a user account. The sub claim is a string that uniquely identifies a given user account. The benefit of using a sub claim is that it will not change, even if other user attributes (email, phone number, etc) associated with that account are updated. If no user record is storing the sub claim value, then you should allow the user to associate his new or existing account to the sub. All these flows are depicted in the itsme® B2B portal. Benefit of sub claim . The benefit of using a sub claim is that it will not change, not even if other user attributes (email, phone number, etc.) associated with that account are updated. Deleting and re-creating an itsme® account . In a limited number of cases (e.g. technical issue,…) a user could ask itsme® to ‘delete’ his account. As a result the specific account will be ‘archived’ (for compliancy reasons) and thus also the unique identifier(s) (e.g. “sub”). If the same user would opt to re-create an itsme® afterwards, he will need to re-bind his itsme® account with your application server, in the same way as for the initial binding. After successful re-binding you will need to overwrite the initial reference with the new sub claim value in your database. ",

When implementing the Identification service, you MUST at least specify one user claim in the scope parameter - profile email address ... - or in the claims parameter - name birthdatehttp://itsme.services/v2/claim/claim_citizenship. Parameters . | client_idREQUIRED | It identifies your application. This parameter value is generated during registration. | . | response_typeREQUIRED | This defines the processing flow to be used when forming the response. Because itsme® supports the Authorization Code Flow, this value MUST be code. | . | scopeREQUIRED | It allows your application to express the desired scope of the access request. Each scope returns a set of user attributes. The scopes an application should request depend on which user attributes your application needs. Once the user authorizes the requested scopes, his details are returned in an ID Token and are also available through the UserInfo Endpoint.All scope values must be space-separated.The basic (and required) scopes are openid and service. Beyond that, your application can ask for additional standard scopes values which map to sets of related claims are: profile email address phone eid | serviceREQUIRED | It indicates the itsme® service your application intends to use, e.g. service:TEST_code by replacing \"TEST_code\" with the service code generated during registration. | . | openidREQUIRED | It indicates that your application intends to use the OpenID Connect protocol to verify a user's identity by returning a sub claim which represents a unique identifier for the authenticated user. | . | profileOPTIONAL | Returns claims that represent basic profile information, specifically family_name, given_name, name, gender, locale, picture and birthdate. | . | emailOPTIONAL | Returns the email claim, which contains the user's email address, and email_verified, which is a boolean indicating whether the email address was verified by the user. | . | addressOPTIONAL | Returns the information about the user's postal address.

This number consists of 11 digits of the form yy.mm.dd-xxx.cd where yy.mm.dd is the birthdate of the person, xxx a sequential number (odd for males and even for females) and cd a check-digit. | . | . | redirect_uriREQUIRED | It is the URL to which users are redirected once the authentication is complete. The following restrictions apply to redirect URIs: The redirect URI MUST match the value preregistered during the registration. The redirect URI MUST begin with the scheme https (refer to this section for more information). There is an exception for localhost redirect URIs that are only permitted for development purposes, it’s not for use in production. The redirect URI is case-sensitive. Its case MUST match the case of the URL path of your running application. For example, if your application includes as part of its path .../abc/response-oidc, do not specify .../ABC/response-oidc in the redirect URI. Because the web browser treats paths as case-sensitive, cookies associated with .../abc/response-oidc MAY be excluded if redirected to the case-mismatched .../ABC/response-oidc URL. If relevant (in case you have a mobile app) make sure that your redirect URIs support the Universal links and App links mechanism. Functionally, it will allow you to have only one single link that will either open your desktop web application, your mobile app or your mobile site on the User’s device. Universal links and App links are standard web links (http://mydomain.com) that point to both a web page and a piece of content inside an app. When a Universal Link is opened, the app OS checks to see if any installed app is registered for that domain.

You SHOULD validate that the value returned matches the one supplied. | . | GET https://oidc.[e2e/prd].itsme.services/clientsecret-oidc/csapi/v0.1/connect/authorize . When implementing the Identification service, you MUST at least specify one user claim in the scope parameter - profile email address ... - or in the claims parameter - name birthdatehttp://itsme.services/v2/claim/claim_citizenship. Parameters . | client_idREQUIRED | It identifies your application. This parameter value is generated during registration. | . | response_typeREQUIRED | This defines the processing flow to be used when forming the response. Because itsme® supports the Authorization Code Flow, this value MUST be code. | . | scopeREQUIRED | It allows your application to express the desired scope of the access request. Each scope returns a set of user attributes. The scopes an application should request depend on which user attributes your application needs. Once the user authorizes the requested scopes, his details are returned in an ID Token and are also available through the UserInfo Endpoint.All scope values must be space-separated.The basic (and required) scopes are openid and service. Beyond that, your application can ask for additional standard scopes values which map to sets of related claims are: profile email address phone eid | serviceREQUIRED | It indicates the itsme® service your application intends to use, e.g. service:TEST_code by replacing \"TEST_code\" with the service code generated during registration. | . | openidREQUIRED | It indicates that your application intends to use the OpenID Connect protocol to verify a user's identity by returning a sub claim which represents a unique identifier for the authenticated user. | . | profileOPTIONAL | Returns claims that represent basic profile information, specifically family_name, given_name, name, gender, locale, picture and birthdate. | . | emailOPTIONAL | Returns the email claim, which contains the user's email address, and email_verified, which is a boolean indicating whether the email address was verified by the user. | . | addressOPTIONAL | Returns the information about the user's postal address. The value of the address member is a JSON structure containing some or all of these members formatted street_address postal_code locality country | . | phoneOPTIONAL | Returns the phone claim, which contains the user's phone number, and phone_number_verified, which is a boolean indicating whether the phone number was verified by the user. | . | eidOPTIONAL | Returns the unique identification number of natural persons who are registered in Belgium.

The following restrictions apply to redirect URIs: The redirect URI MUST match the value preregistered during the registration. The redirect URI MUST begin with the scheme https (refer to this section for more information). There is an exception for localhost redirect URIs that are only permitted for development purposes, it’s not for use in production. The redirect URI is case-sensitive. Its case MUST match the case of the URL path of your running application. For example, if your application includes as part of its path .../abc/response-oidc, do not specify .../ABC/response-oidc in the redirect URI. Because the web browser treats paths as case-sensitive, cookies associated with .../abc/response-oidc MAY be excluded if redirected to the case-mismatched .../ABC/response-oidc URL. If relevant (in case you have a mobile app) make sure that your redirect URIs support the Universal links and App links mechanism. Functionally, it will allow you to have only one single link that will either open your desktop web application, your mobile app or your mobile site on the User’s device. Universal links and App links are standard web links (http://mydomain.com) that point to both a web page and a piece of content inside an app. When a Universal Link is opened, the app OS checks to see if any installed app is registered for that domain. If so, the app is launched immediately without ever loading the web page. If not, the web URL is loaded into the webbrowser. | . | stateStrongly RECOMMENDED | Specifies any string value that your application uses to maintain state between your Authorization Request and the Authorization Server's response. You can use this parameter for several purposes, such as directing the user to the correct resource in your application and mitigating cross-site request forgery. | . | nonceStrongly RECOMMENDED | A string value used to associate a session with an ID Token, and to mitigate replay attacks.
