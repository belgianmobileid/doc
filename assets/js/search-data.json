    "content": "To protect the exchange of sensitive information and ensure the requested information gets issued to a legitimate application and not some other party, the OpenID Connect protocol uses JSON Web Token (JWT) which can be signed and/or encrypted. Among the methods described in OpenID specification, itsme® supports 2 authentication methods to secure communications between your backend and itsme®: . | \"Private key JWT\" is based on a public/private key pair (asymmetric encryption). It is therefore the most secure option | \"Client secret\" is based on a shared Secret key (symmetric encryption). It can be easier to implement in some cases | . You will have to choose between one of these methods when registering your project. Public- and private-key method and JWKSet URI . This method uses linked public- and private-key pairs to encrypt and decrypt senders’ and recipients’ sensitive data. It is also known as public-key cryptography or public-key encryption. This method requires that each party exposes its public keys as a simple JWK Set document on a URI publicly accessible, and keep its private keys for itself. Using the jwks_uri key retrieve the URI for itsme® from the itsme® Discovery document, . Your public and private key can be generated using your own tool or via Yeoman. If using Yeoman, you need to install generator-itsme with NPM: . $ npm install -g yo generator-itsme . After installation, run the generator: . $ yo itsme . The Yeoman tool will generate two files, the jwks_private.json which MUST be stored securely in your system, and the jwks_public.json which needs to be exposed as a JWK Set on a URI publicly accessible and have the HTTPS scheme . Refer to this section for more information. Whatever the tool you are choosing to create your key pairs, don't forget to send your JWK Set URI by email to onboarding@itsme.be and itsme® will make sure to complete the configuration for you in no time! The algorithms – needed to sign and/or encrypt a JWT or to authenticate to our Token Endpoint – are listed in the itsme® Discovery document for more information. Secret key method . Secret key cryptography method uses the same secret key to encrypt and decrypt sensitive information. This approach is the inverse of public- and private-key encryption. This method requires the exchange of a static secret to be held by both the sender and the data receiver. The secret value will be provided by itsme® when registering your project. The algorithms – needed to sign and/or encrypt a JWT or to authenticate to our Token Endpoint – are listed in the itsme® Discovery document for more information. If you choose to go with the secret key method, you will be able to specify if the ID Token JWT needs to be signed with the an asymmetric algorithm (e.g. RS256) or with a symmetric algorithm (e.g. : HS256). When using the RS256 algorithm, our public keys will be needed to verify the signature. This information can be found in our itsme® Discovery document, using the key jwks_uri. PKCE-enhanced flow . Whatever the chosen authentication method, itsme® also supports an extra security extension named Proof of Key for Code Exchange (PKCE). This additionnal layer of security is intended mitigate some Authorization Code interception attacks. We strongly advise to enable enforcement of this mechanism. Please ask our onboarding team to do so when registering your project. PKCE implies choosing a random string, named code_verifier, and then generating a SHA256 hash of that string, named code_challenge. The code_challenge has to be sent along with the Authorization Request, while the code_verifier must be sent with the Token Request, allowing our backend to make sure both requests are issued by the same source. code_verifier MUST contain only the unreserved characters [A-Z] / [a-z] / [0-9] / \"-\" / \".\" / \"_\" / \"~\", with a minimum length of 43 characters and a maximum length of 128 characters. code_challenge can then be obtained via this kind of instructions: . var hash = code_verifier.createHash('sha256'); var code_challenge = base64url.encode(hash); . Signing, encrypting and decoding JWTs . Libraries implementing JWT and the JOSE specs JWS, JWE, JWK, and JWA are listed here. ",

    "content": "itsme® requires https connections to guarantee security. With the https protocol, a web site operator obtains a certificate by applying to a certificate authority with a certificate signing request. The certificate request is an electronic document that contains the web site name, company information and the public key. The certificate provider signs the request, thus producing a public certificate. During web browsing, this public certificate is served to any web browser that connects to the web site and proves to the web browser that the provider believes it has issued a certificate to the owner of the web site. A certificate provider can opt to issue three types of certificates, each requiring its own degree of vetting rigor. In order of increasing rigor (and naturally, cost) they are: Domain Validation, Organization Validation and Extended Validation. The Domain Validation certificate doesn’t provide sufficient identity guarantees to itsme. So, only the Organization Validation and Extended Validation certificates are supported. For example, using the Let’s Encrypt open certificate authority is not suffcient because it only provide standard Domain Validation certificates. The chain of trust of these certificates need to be publicly accessible, meaning that our systems need to be able to access the root and the intermediate certificates. All itsme® API URL we publish use https. All requests to our endpoints MUST also use the SNI extension (refer to the RFC for more information) of the TLS protocol, that allows our servers to provide you with the correct certificate based on which endpoint you are querying.

If the request fails due to a missing, invalid, or mismatching redirection URI, or if the client identifier is missing or invalid,… the Authorization Endpoint will inform you of the error our itsme® sign-in page. If the User denies the access request or the User authentication fails, the Authorization Endpoint will inform you by adding the following parameters to the query component of the redirection URI using the application/x-www-form-urlencoded format : . | error REQUIRED | A single ASCII error code. | invalid_request | The request is missing a required parameter, includes an invalid parameter value, includes a parameter more than once, or is otherwise malformed. | . | access_denied | The User or the Authorization Endpoint denied the request. | . | login_required | The Authorization Endpoint requires User authentication. This error MAY be returned when the prompt parameter value in the Authorization Request is none | . | interaction_required | The Authorization Endpoint requires User interaction of some form to proceed. This error MAY be returned when the prompt parameter value in the Authorization Request is none, but the Autorization Request cannot be completed without displaying a user interface for User interaction. | . | unsupported_request | The request contains a not supported parameter. | . | invalid_client_id | The request contains an invalid client_id. | . | invalid_redirect_uri | The request contains an invalid redirect URI. | . | unsupported_grant_type | Grant type not supported. | . | invalid_grant | Invalid grant. | . | invalid_scope | The requested scope is invalid, unknown, or malformed. | . | unsupported_display | Only page is supported. | . | unauthorized_client | Unknown or unspecified client_id. | . | unsupported_response_type | The Authorization Endpoint does not support obtaining an authorization code using this method. | . | invalid_request_object | The request parameter contains an invalid Request Object. | . | invalid_request_uri | The request_uri in the Authorization Request returns an error or contains invalid data. | . | invalid_request | Oauth2 parameters do not match Request object. | . | temporary_unavailable | The authorization server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overloading or maintenance of the server. | . | . | error_description OPTIONAL | Human-readable text providing additional information, used to assist the developer in understanding the error that occurred. | . | state | The string value provided in the Authorization Request. You SHOULD validate that the value returned matches the one supplied. | . For example : . HTTP/1.1 302 Found Location: https://client.example.com/cb?error=access_denied&amp;state=xyz . Token Endpoint errors . If the request fails the Token Endpoint responds with an HTTP 400 (Bad Request) status code (unless specified otherwise) and includes the following parameters in the entity-body of the HTTP response using the application/json media type : . | error REQUIRED | A single ASCII error code. | invalid_request | The request is missing a required parameter, includes an unsupported parameter value (other than grant type), repeats a parameter, includes multiple credentials, utilizes more than one mechanism for authenticating the client, or is otherwise malformed. | . | invalid_client | Client authentication failed (e.g., unknown client, no client authentication included, or unsupported authentication method). | . | invalid_grant | The provided authorization grant (e.g., authorization code, resource owner credentials) is invalid, expired or does not match the redirection URI used in the authorization request. | . | unauthorized_client | The authenticated client is not authorized to use this authorization grant type. | . | . | error_description OPTIONAL | Human-readable text providing additional information, used to assist the developer in understanding the error that occurred. | . | state | The string value provided in the Authorization Request.

HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8 Cache-Control: no-store Pragma: no-cache { \"error\":\"invalid_request\" } . UserInfo Endpoint errors . When a request fails, the UserInfo Endpoint responds using the appropriate HTTP status code (typically, 400, 401, 403, or 405) and includes specific error codes in the response. | invalid_request | The request is missing a required parameter, includes an unsupported parameter or parameter value, repeats the same parameter, uses more than one method for including an access token, or is otherwise malformed. | . | invalid_token | The access token provided is expired, revoked, malformed, or invalid for other reasons. | . For example : . HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm=\"example\" . Revocation Endpoint errors . If the request fails the Revoke Endpoint responds with an HTTP 400 (Bad Request) status code and includes the fllowing parameters in the entity-body of the HTTP response using the application/json media type : . | error REQUIRED | A single ASCII error code. | invalid_request | The request is missing a required parameter, includes an unsupported parameter value (other than grant type), repeats a parameter, includes multiple credentials, utilizes more than one mechanism for authenticating the client, or is otherwise malformed. | . | invalid_client | Client authentication failed (e.g., unknown client, no client authentication included, or unsupported authentication method). | . | invalid_grant | The provided authorization grant (e.g., authorization code, resource owner credentials) is invalid, expired or does not match the redirection URI used in the authorization request. | . | unauthorized_client | The authenticated client is not authorized to use this authorization grant type. | . | unsupported_token_type | itsme® does not support the revocation of the presented access token. | . | . | error_description OPTIONAL | Human-readable text providing additional information, used to assist the developer in understanding the error that occurred. | . | state | The string value provided in the Authorization Request.

    "content": "Mapping using sub claim . To sign in successfully in your web desktop, mobile web or mobile application, a given user must be mapped to a user account in your database. By default, your application Server will use the subject identifier, or sub claim, in the ID Token to identify and verify a user account. The sub claim is a string that uniquely identifies a given user account. The benefit of using a sub claim is that it will not change, even if other user attributes (email, phone number, etc) associated with that account are updated. If no user record is storing the sub claim value, then you should allow the user to associate his new or existing account to the sub. All these flows are depicted in the itsme® B2B portal. Benefit of sub claim . The benefit of using a sub claim is that it will not change, not even if other user attributes (email, phone number, etc.) associated with that account are updated. Deleting and re-creating an itsme® account . In a limited number of cases (e.g. technical issue,…) a user could ask itsme® to ‘delete’ his account. As a result the specific account will be ‘archived’ (for compliancy reasons) and thus also the unique identifier(s) (e.g. “sub”). If the same user would opt to re-create an itsme® afterwards, he will need to re-bind his itsme® account with your application server, in the same way as for the initial binding. After successful re-binding you will need to overwrite the initial reference with the new sub claim value in your database. ",

Because itsme® supports the Authorization Code Flow, this value MUST be code. | . | scope REQUIRED | It allows your application to express the desired scope of the access request. Each scope returns a set of user attributes. The scopes an application should request depend on which user attributes your application needs. Once the user authorizes the requested scopes, his details are returned in an ID Token and are also available through the UserInfo Endpoint.All scope values must be space-separated.The basic (and required) scopes are openid and service. Beyond that, your application can ask for additional standard scopes values which map to sets of related claims are: profile email address phone eid | service REQUIRED | It indicates the itsme® service your application intends to use, e.g. service:TEST_code by replacing \"TEST_code\" with the service code generated during registration. | . | openid REQUIRED | It indicates that your application intends to use the OpenID Connect protocol to verify a user's identity by returning a sub claim which represents a unique identifier for the authenticated user. | . | profile OPTIONAL | Returns claims that represent basic profile information, specifically family_name, given_name, name, gender, locale, picture and birthdate.If requested, a value SHALL always be returned for the above claims except for the given_name claim which MAY NOT be returned if the user doesn't have any first name(s). | . | email OPTIONAL | Returns the email claim, which contains the user's email address, and email_verified, which is a boolean indicating whether the email address was verified by the user.If requested, a value SHALL always be returned for the email_verified claim only if email claim is filled with a value, whereas the email claim SHALL always be returned only if the user gave us an email address. | . | address OPTIONAL | Returns user's postal address, represented as JSON Object containing some or all of these members formatted street_address postal_code localityIf requested, a value SHALL always be returned for users with a Belgian ID document, and SHALL NOT be returned for users with a Dutch ID documents. | . | phone OPTIONAL | Returns the phone_number claim, which contains the user's phone number, and phone_number_verified, which is a boolean indicating whether the phone number was verified by the user.If requested, a value SHALL always be returned for the above claims. | . | eid OPTIONAL | Returns the http://itsme.services/v2/claim/BENationalNumbe claim, which contains the unique identification number of natural persons who are registered in Belgium, and http://itsme.services/v2/claim/BEeidSn, which is a string indicating the Belgian ID card number.If requested, a value SHALL always be returned for the above claims. | . | . | redirect_uri REQUIRED | It is the URL to which users are redirected once the authentication is complete.

    "title": "Securing the exchange of information",
    "content": "To protect the exchange of sensitive information and ensure the requested information gets issued to a legitimate application and not some other party, the OpenID Connect protocol uses JSON Web Token (JWT) which can be signed and/or encrypted. Among the methods described in OpenID specification, itsme® supports 2 authentication methods to secure communications between your backend and itsme®: . | \"Private key JWT\" is based on a public/private key pair (asymmetric encryption). It is therefore the most secure option | \"Client secret\" is based on a shared Secret key (symmetric encryption). It can be easier to implement in some cases | . You will have to choose between one of these methods when registering your project. Public- and private-key method and JWKSet URI . This method uses linked public- and private-key pairs to encrypt and decrypt senders’ and recipients’ sensitive data. It is also known as public-key cryptography or public-key encryption. This method requires that each party exposes its public keys as a simple JWK Set document on a URI publicly accessible, and keep its private keys for itself. Using the jwks_uri key retrieve the URI for itsme® from the itsme® Discovery document, . Your public and private key can be generated using your own tool or via Yeoman. If using Yeoman, you need to install generator-itsme with NPM: . $ npm install -g yo generator-itsme . After installation, run the generator: . $ yo itsme . The Yeoman tool will generate two files, the jwks_private.json which MUST be stored securely in your system, and the jwks_public.json which needs to be exposed as a JWK Set on a URI publicly accessible and have the HTTPS scheme . Refer to this section for more information. Whatever the tool you are choosing to create your key pairs, don't forget to send your JWK Set URI by email to onboarding@itsme.be and itsme® will make sure to complete the configuration for you in no time! The algorithms – needed to sign and/or encrypt a JWT or to authenticate to our Token Endpoint – are listed in the itsme® Discovery document for more information. Secret key method . Secret key cryptography method uses the same secret key to encrypt and decrypt sensitive information. This approach is the inverse of public- and private-key encryption. This method requires the exchange of a static secret to be held by both the sender and the data receiver. The secret value will be provided by itsme® when registering your project. The algorithms – needed to sign and/or encrypt a JWT or to authenticate to our Token Endpoint – are listed in the itsme® Discovery document for more information. If you choose to go with the secret key method, you will be able to specify if the ID Token JWT needs to be signed with the an asymmetric algorithm (e.g. RS256) or with a symmetric algorithm (e.g. : HS256). When using the RS256 algorithm, our public keys will be needed to verify the signature. This information can be found in our itsme® Discovery document, using the key jwks_uri. PKCE-enhanced flow . Whatever the chosen authentication method, itsme® also supports an extra security extension named Proof of Key for Code Exchange (PKCE). This additionnal layer of security is intended mitigate some Authorization Code interception attacks. We strongly advise to enable enforcement of this mechanism. Please ask our onboarding team to do so when registering your project. PKCE implies choosing a random string, named code_verifier, and then generating a SHA256 hash of that string, named code_challenge. The code_challenge has to be sent along with the Authorization Request, while the code_verifier must be sent with the Token Request, allowing our backend to make sure both requests are issued by the same source. code_verifier MUST contain only the unreserved characters [A-Z] / [a-z] / [0-9] / \"-\" / \".\" / \"_\" / \"~\", with a minimum length of 43 characters and a maximum length of 128 characters. code_challenge can then be obtained via this kind of instructions: . var hash = code_verifier.createHash('sha256'); var code_challenge = base64url.encode(hash); .

With the https protocol, a web site operator obtains a certificate by applying to a certificate authority with a certificate signing request. The certificate request is an electronic document that contains the web site name, company information and the public key. The certificate provider signs the request, thus producing a public certificate. During web browsing, this public certificate is served to any web browser that connects to the web site and proves to the web browser that the provider believes it has issued a certificate to the owner of the web site. A certificate provider can opt to issue three types of certificates, each requiring its own degree of vetting rigor. In order of increasing rigor (and naturally, cost) they are: Domain Validation, Organization Validation and Extended Validation. The Domain Validation certificate doesn’t provide sufficient identity guarantees to itsme. So, only the Organization Validation and Extended Validation certificates are supported. For example, using the Let’s Encrypt open certificate authority is not suffcient because it only provide standard Domain Validation certificates. The chain of trust of these certificates need to be publicly accessible, meaning that our systems need to be able to access the root and the intermediate certificates. All itsme® API URL we publish use https. All requests to our endpoints MUST also use the SNI extension (refer to the RFC for more information) of the TLS protocol, that allows our servers to provide you with the correct certificate based on which endpoint you are querying.

The error responses . Things will sometimes go wrong. So, OpenID Connect defines a number of rules regarding the format of errors returned from our endpoints. Authorization Endpoint errors . If the request fails due to a missing, invalid, or mismatching redirection URI, or if the client identifier is missing or invalid,… the Authorization Endpoint will inform you of the error our itsme® sign-in page. If the User denies the access request or the User authentication fails, the Authorization Endpoint will inform you by adding the following parameters to the query component of the redirection URI using the application/x-www-form-urlencoded format : . | error REQUIRED | A single ASCII error code. | invalid_request | The request is missing a required parameter, includes an invalid parameter value, includes a parameter more than once, or is otherwise malformed. | . | access_denied | The User or the Authorization Endpoint denied the request. | . | login_required | The Authorization Endpoint requires User authentication. This error MAY be returned when the prompt parameter value in the Authorization Request is none | . | interaction_required | The Authorization Endpoint requires User interaction of some form to proceed. This error MAY be returned when the prompt parameter value in the Authorization Request is none, but the Autorization Request cannot be completed without displaying a user interface for User interaction. | . | unsupported_request | The request contains a not supported parameter. | . | invalid_client_id | The request contains an invalid client_id. | . | invalid_redirect_uri | The request contains an invalid redirect URI. | . | unsupported_grant_type | Grant type not supported. | . | invalid_grant | Invalid grant. | . | invalid_scope | The requested scope is invalid, unknown, or malformed. | . | unsupported_display | Only page is supported. | . | unauthorized_client | Unknown or unspecified client_id. | . | unsupported_response_type | The Authorization Endpoint does not support obtaining an authorization code using this method. | . | invalid_request_object | The request parameter contains an invalid Request Object. | . | invalid_request_uri | The request_uri in the Authorization Request returns an error or contains invalid data. | . | invalid_request | Oauth2 parameters do not match Request object. | . | temporary_unavailable | The authorization server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overloading or maintenance of the server. | . | . | error_description OPTIONAL | Human-readable text providing additional information, used to assist the developer in understanding the error that occurred. | . | state | The string value provided in the Authorization Request. You SHOULD validate that the value returned matches the one supplied. | . For example : . HTTP/1.1 302 Found Location: https://client.example.com/cb?error=access_denied&amp;state=xyz . Token Endpoint errors . If the request fails the Token Endpoint responds with an HTTP 400 (Bad Request) status code (unless specified otherwise) and includes the following parameters in the entity-body of the HTTP response using the application/json media type : . | error REQUIRED | A single ASCII error code. | invalid_request | The request is missing a required parameter, includes an unsupported parameter value (other than grant type), repeats a parameter, includes multiple credentials, utilizes more than one mechanism for authenticating the client, or is otherwise malformed. | . | invalid_client | Client authentication failed (e.g., unknown client, no client authentication included, or unsupported authentication method). | . | invalid_grant | The provided authorization grant (e.g., authorization code, resource owner credentials) is invalid, expired or does not match the redirection URI used in the authorization request. | . | unauthorized_client | The authenticated client is not authorized to use this authorization grant type. | . | . | error_description OPTIONAL | Human-readable text providing additional information, used to assist the developer in understanding the error that occurred. | . | state | The string value provided in the Authorization Request.

When a request fails, the UserInfo Endpoint responds using the appropriate HTTP status code (typically, 400, 401, 403, or 405) and includes specific error codes in the response. | invalid_request | The request is missing a required parameter, includes an unsupported parameter or parameter value, repeats the same parameter, uses more than one method for including an access token, or is otherwise malformed. | . | invalid_token | The access token provided is expired, revoked, malformed, or invalid for other reasons. | . For example : . HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm=\"example\" . Revocation Endpoint errors .

By default, your application Server will use the subject identifier, or sub claim, in the ID Token to identify and verify a user account. The sub claim is a string that uniquely identifies a given user account. The benefit of using a sub claim is that it will not change, even if other user attributes (email, phone number, etc) associated with that account are updated. If no user record is storing the sub claim value, then you should allow the user to associate his new or existing account to the sub. All these flows are depicted in the itsme® B2B portal. Benefit of sub claim . The benefit of using a sub claim is that it will not change, not even if other user attributes (email, phone number, etc.) associated with that account are updated. Deleting and re-creating an itsme® account . In a limited number of cases (e.g. technical issue,…) a user could ask itsme® to ‘delete’ his account. As a result the specific account will be ‘archived’ (for compliancy reasons) and thus also the unique identifier(s) (e.g. “sub”). If the same user would opt to re-create an itsme® afterwards, he will need to re-bind his itsme® account with your application server, in the same way as for the initial binding. After successful re-binding you will need to overwrite the initial reference with the new sub claim value in your database. ",

This parameter value is generated during registration. | . | response_type REQUIRED | This defines the processing flow to be used when forming the response. Because itsme® supports the Authorization Code Flow, this value MUST be code. | . | scope REQUIRED | It allows your application to express the desired scope of the access request. Each scope returns a set of user attributes. The scopes an application should request depend on which user attributes your application needs. Once the user authorizes the requested scopes, his details are returned in an ID Token and are also available through the UserInfo Endpoint.All scope values must be space-separated.The basic (and required) scopes are openid and service. Beyond that, your application can ask for additional standard scopes values which map to sets of related claims are: profile email address phone eid | service REQUIRED | It indicates the itsme® service your application intends to use, e.g. service:TEST_code by replacing \"TEST_code\" with the service code generated during registration. | . | openid REQUIRED | It indicates that your application intends to use the OpenID Connect protocol to verify a user's identity by returning a sub claim which represents a unique identifier for the authenticated user. | . | profile OPTIONAL | Returns claims that represent basic profile information, specifically family_name, given_name, name, gender, locale, picture and birthdate.If requested, a value SHALL always be returned for the above claims except for the given_name claim which MAY NOT be returned if the user doesn't have any first name(s). | . | email OPTIONAL | Returns the email claim, which contains the user's email address, and email_verified, which is a boolean indicating whether the email address was verified by the user.If requested, a value SHALL always be returned for the email_verified claim only if email claim is filled with a value, whereas the email claim SHALL always be returned only if the user gave us an email address. | . | address OPTIONAL | Returns user's postal address, represented as JSON Object containing some or all of these members formatted street_address postal_code localityIf requested, a value SHALL always be returned for users with a Belgian ID document, and SHALL NOT be returned for users with a Dutch ID documents. | . | phone OPTIONAL | Returns the phone_number claim, which contains the user's phone number, and phone_number_verified, which is a boolean indicating whether the phone number was verified by the user.If requested, a value SHALL always be returned for the above claims. | . | eid OPTIONAL | Returns the http://itsme.services/v2/claim/BENationalNumbe claim, which contains the unique identification number of natural persons who are registered in Belgium, and http://itsme.services/v2/claim/BEeidSn, which is a string indicating the Belgian ID card number.If requested, a value SHALL always be returned for the above claims. | . | . | redirect_uri REQUIRED | It is the URL to which users are redirected once the authentication is complete. The following restrictions apply to redirect URIs: The redirect URI MUST match the value preregistered during the registration. The redirect URI MUST begin with the scheme https (refer to this section for more information). There is an exception for localhost redirect URIs that are only permitted for development purposes, it’s not for use in production. The redirect URI SHALL NOT be a custom URL. The fragment identifier introduced by a hash mark # SHALL NOT be used. The redirect URI is case-sensitive. Its case MUST match the case of the URL path of your running application. For example, if your application includes as part of its path .../abc/response-oidc, do not specify .../ABC/response-oidc in the redirect URI. Because the web browser treats paths as case-sensitive, cookies associated with .../abc/response-oidc MAY be excluded if redirected to the case-mismatched .../ABC/response-oidc URL. If relevant (in case you have a mobile app) make sure that your redirect URIs support the Universal links and App links mechanism. Functionally, it will allow you to have only one single link that will either open your desktop web application, your mobile app or your mobile site on the User’s device. Universal links and App links are standard web links (http://mydomain.com) that point to both a web page and a piece of content inside an app. When a Universal Link is opened, the app OS checks to see if any installed app is registered for that domain. If so, the app is launched immediately without ever loading the web page. If not, the web URL is loaded into the webbrowser. | . | state Strongly RECOMMENDED | Specifies any string value that your application uses to maintain state between your Authorization Request and the Authorization Server's response. You can use this parameter for several purposes, such as directing the user to the correct resource in your application and mitigating cross-site request forgery. | . | nonce Strongly RECOMMENDED | A string value used to associate a session with an ID Token, and to mitigate replay attacks.

You SHOULD validate that the value returned matches the one supplied. | . | GET https://oidc.[e2e/prd].itsme.services/clientsecret-oidc/csapi/v0.1/connect/authorize . Parameters . | client_id REQUIRED | It identifies your application. This parameter value is generated during registration. | . | response_type REQUIRED | This defines the processing flow to be used when forming the response. Because itsme® supports the Authorization Code Flow, this value MUST be code. | . | scope REQUIRED | It allows your application to express the desired scope of the access request. Each scope returns a set of user attributes. The scopes an application should request depend on which user attributes your application needs. Once the user authorizes the requested scopes, his details are returned in an ID Token and are also available through the UserInfo Endpoint.All scope values must be space-separated.The basic (and required) scopes are openid and service. Beyond that, your application can ask for additional standard scopes values which map to sets of related claims are: profile email address phone eid | service REQUIRED | It indicates the itsme® service your application intends to use, e.g. service:TEST_code by replacing \"TEST_code\" with the service code generated during registration. | . | openid REQUIRED | It indicates that your application intends to use the OpenID Connect protocol to verify a user's identity by returning a sub claim which represents a unique identifier for the authenticated user. | . | profile OPTIONAL | Returns claims that represent basic profile information, specifically family_name, given_name, name, gender, locale, picture and birthdate.If requested, a value SHALL always be returned for the above claims except for the given_name claim which MAY NOT be returned if the user doesn't have any first name(s). | . | email OPTIONAL | Returns the email claim, which contains the user's email address, and email_verified, which is a boolean indicating whether the email address was verified by the user.If requested, a value SHALL always be returned for the email_verified claim only if email claim is filled with a value, whereas the email claim SHALL always be returned only if the user gave us an email address. | . | address OPTIONAL | Returns user's postal address, represented as JSON Object containing some or all of these members formatted street_address postal_code localityIf requested, a value SHALL always be returned for users with a Belgian ID document, and SHALL NOT be returned for users with a Dutch ID documents. | . | phone OPTIONAL | Returns the phone_number claim, which contains the user's phone number, and phone_number_verified, which is a boolean indicating whether the phone number was verified by the user.If requested, a value SHALL always be returned for the above claims. | . | eid OPTIONAL | Returns the http://itsme.services/v2/claim/BENationalNumbe claim, which contains the unique identification number of natural persons who are registered in Belgium, and http://itsme.services/v2/claim/BEeidSn, which is a string indicating the Belgian ID card number.If requested, a value SHALL always be returned for the above claims. | . | . | redirect_uri REQUIRED | It is the URL to which users are redirected once the authentication is complete. The following restrictions apply to redirect URIs: The redirect URI MUST match the value preregistered during the registration. The redirect URI MUST begin with the scheme https (refer to this section for more information). There is an exception for localhost redirect URIs that are only permitted for development purposes, it’s not for use in production. The redirect URI SHALL NOT be a custom URL. The fragment identifier introduced by a hash mark # SHALL NOT be used. The redirect URI is case-sensitive. Its case MUST match the case of the URL path of your running application. For example, if your application includes as part of its path .../abc/response-oidc, do not specify .../ABC/response-oidc in the redirect URI. Because the web browser treats paths as case-sensitive, cookies associated with .../abc/response-oidc MAY be excluded if redirected to the case-mismatched .../ABC/response-oidc URL. If relevant (in case you have a mobile app) make sure that your redirect URIs support the Universal links and App links mechanism. Functionally, it will allow you to have only one single link that will either open your desktop web application, your mobile app or your mobile site on the User’s device. Universal links and App links are standard web links (http://mydomain.com) that point to both a web page and a piece of content inside an app. When a Universal Link is opened, the app OS checks to see if any installed app is registered for that domain. If so, the app is launched immediately without ever loading the web page. If not, the web URL is loaded into the webbrowser. | . | state Strongly RECOMMENDED | Specifies any string value that your application uses to maintain state between your Authorization Request and the Authorization Server's response. You can use this parameter for several purposes, such as directing the user to the correct resource in your application and mitigating cross-site request forgery. | . | nonce Strongly RECOMMENDED | A string value used to associate a session with an ID Token, and to mitigate replay attacks.

    "title": "Securing the exchange of information",
    "content": "To protect the exchange of sensitive information and ensure the requested information gets issued to a legitimate application and not some other party, the OpenID Connect protocol uses JSON Web Token (JWT) which can be signed and/or encrypted. Among the methods described in OpenID specification, itsme® supports 2 authentication methods to secure communications between your backend and itsme®: . | \"Private key JWT\" is based on a public/private key pair (asymmetric encryption). It is therefore the most secure option | \"Client secret\" is based on a shared Secret key (symmetric encryption). It can be easier to implement in some cases | . You will have to choose between one of these methods when registering your project. Public- and private-key method and JWKSet URI . This method uses linked public- and private-key pairs to encrypt and decrypt senders’ and recipients’ sensitive data. It is also known as public-key cryptography or public-key encryption. This method requires that each party exposes its public keys as a simple JWK Set document on a URI publicly accessible, and keep its private keys for itself. Using the jwks_uri key retrieve the URI for itsme® from the itsme® Discovery document, . Your public and private key can be generated using your own tool or via Yeoman. If using Yeoman, you need to install generator-itsme with NPM: . $ npm install -g yo generator-itsme . After installation, run the generator: . $ yo itsme . The Yeoman tool will generate two files, the jwks_private.json which MUST be stored securely in your system, and the jwks_public.json which needs to be exposed as a JWK Set on a URI publicly accessible and have the HTTPS scheme . Refer to this section for more information. Whatever the tool you are choosing to create your key pairs, don't forget to send your JWK Set URI by email to onboarding@itsme.be and itsme® will make sure to complete the configuration for you in no time! The algorithms – needed to sign and/or encrypt a JWT or to authenticate to our Token Endpoint – are listed in the itsme® Discovery document for more information. Secret key method . Secret key cryptography method uses the same secret key to encrypt and decrypt sensitive information. This approach is the inverse of public- and private-key encryption. This method requires the exchange of a static secret to be held by both the sender and the data receiver. The secret value will be provided by itsme® when registering your project. The algorithms – needed to sign and/or encrypt a JWT or to authenticate to our Token Endpoint – are listed in the itsme® Discovery document for more information. If you choose to go with the secret key method, you will be able to specify if the ID Token JWT needs to be signed with the an asymmetric algorithm (e.g. RS256) or with a symmetric algorithm (e.g. : HS256). When using the RS256 algorithm, our public keys will be needed to verify the signature. This information can be found in our itsme® Discovery document, using the key jwks_uri. PKCE-enhanced flow . Whatever the chosen authentication method, itsme® also supports an extra security extension named Proof of Key for Code Exchange (PKCE). This additionnal layer of security is intended mitigate some Authorization Code interception attacks. We strongly advise to enable enforcement of this mechanism. Please ask our onboarding team to do so when registering your project. PKCE implies choosing a random string, named code_verifier, and then generating a SHA256 hash of that string, named code_challenge. The code_challenge has to be sent along with the Authorization Request, while the code_verifier must be sent with the Token Request, allowing our backend to make sure both requests are issued by the same source. code_verifier MUST contain only the unreserved characters [A-Z] / [a-z] / [0-9] / \"-\" / \".\" / \"_\" / \"~\", with a minimum length of 43 characters and a maximum length of 128 characters. code_challenge can then be obtained via this kind of instructions: . var hash = code_verifier.createHash('sha256'); var code_challenge = base64url.encode(hash); .

    "title": "Certificates and website security",
    "content": "itsme® requires https connections to guarantee security. With the https protocol, a web site operator obtains a certificate by applying to a certificate authority with a certificate signing request. The certificate request is an electronic document that contains the web site name, company information and the public key. The certificate provider signs the request, thus producing a public certificate. During web browsing, this public certificate is served to any web browser that connects to the web site and proves to the web browser that the provider believes it has issued a certificate to the owner of the web site. A certificate provider can opt to issue three types of certificates, each requiring its own degree of vetting rigor. In order of increasing rigor (and naturally, cost) they are: Domain Validation, Organization Validation and Extended Validation. The Domain Validation certificate doesn’t provide sufficient identity guarantees to itsme. So, only the Organization Validation and Extended Validation certificates are supported. For example, using the Let’s Encrypt open certificate authority is not suffcient because it only provide standard Domain Validation certificates. The chain of trust of these certificates need to be publicly accessible, meaning that our systems need to be able to access the root and the intermediate certificates. All itsme® API URL we publish use https. All requests to our endpoints MUST also use the SNI extension (refer to the RFC for more information) of the TLS protocol, that allows our servers to provide you with the correct certificate based on which endpoint you are querying.

If the request fails due to a missing, invalid, or mismatching redirection URI, or if the client identifier is missing or invalid,… the Authorization Endpoint will inform you of the error our itsme® sign-in page. If the User denies the access request or the User authentication fails, the Authorization Endpoint will inform you by adding the following parameters to the query component of the redirection URI using the application/x-www-form-urlencoded format : . | error REQUIRED | A single ASCII error code. | invalid_request | The request is missing a required parameter, includes an invalid parameter value, includes a parameter more than once, or is otherwise malformed. | . | access_denied | The User or the Authorization Endpoint denied the request. | . | login_required | The Authorization Endpoint requires User authentication. This error MAY be returned when the prompt parameter value in the Authorization Request is none | . | interaction_required | The Authorization Endpoint requires User interaction of some form to proceed. This error MAY be returned when the prompt parameter value in the Authorization Request is none, but the Autorization Request cannot be completed without displaying a user interface for User interaction. | . | unsupported_request | The request contains a not supported parameter. | . | invalid_client_id | The request contains an invalid client_id. | . | invalid_redirect_uri | The request contains an invalid redirect URI. | . | unsupported_grant_type | Grant type not supported. | . | invalid_grant | Invalid grant. | . | invalid_scope | The requested scope is invalid, unknown, or malformed. | . | unsupported_display | Only page is supported. | . | unauthorized_client | Unknown or unspecified client_id. | . | unsupported_response_type | The Authorization Endpoint does not support obtaining an authorization code using this method. | . | invalid_request_object | The request parameter contains an invalid Request Object. | . | invalid_request_uri | The request_uri in the Authorization Request returns an error or contains invalid data. | . | invalid_request | Oauth2 parameters do not match Request object. | . | temporary_unavailable | The authorization server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overloading or maintenance of the server. | . | . | error_description OPTIONAL | Human-readable text providing additional information, used to assist the developer in understanding the error that occurred. | . | state | The string value provided in the Authorization Request. You SHOULD validate that the value returned matches the one supplied. | . For example : . HTTP/1.1 302 Found Location: https://client.example.com/cb?error=access_denied&amp;state=xyz . Token Endpoint errors . If the request fails the Token Endpoint responds with an HTTP 400 (Bad Request) status code (unless specified otherwise) and includes the following parameters in the entity-body of the HTTP response using the application/json media type : . | error REQUIRED | A single ASCII error code. | invalid_request | The request is missing a required parameter, includes an unsupported parameter value (other than grant type), repeats a parameter, includes multiple credentials, utilizes more than one mechanism for authenticating the client, or is otherwise malformed. | . | invalid_client | Client authentication failed (e.g., unknown client, no client authentication included, or unsupported authentication method). | . | invalid_grant | The provided authorization grant (e.g., authorization code, resource owner credentials) is invalid, expired or does not match the redirection URI used in the authorization request. | . | unauthorized_client | The authenticated client is not authorized to use this authorization grant type. | . | . | error_description OPTIONAL | Human-readable text providing additional information, used to assist the developer in understanding the error that occurred. | . | state | The string value provided in the Authorization Request.

HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8 Cache-Control: no-store Pragma: no-cache { \"error\":\"invalid_request\" } . UserInfo Endpoint errors . When a request fails, the UserInfo Endpoint responds using the appropriate HTTP status code (typically, 400, 401, 403, or 405) and includes specific error codes in the response. | invalid_request | The request is missing a required parameter, includes an unsupported parameter or parameter value, repeats the same parameter, uses more than one method for including an access token, or is otherwise malformed. | . | invalid_token | The access token provided is expired, revoked, malformed, or invalid for other reasons. | . For example : . HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm=\"example\" . Revocation Endpoint errors . If the request fails the Revoke Endpoint responds with an HTTP 400 (Bad Request) status code and includes the fllowing parameters in the entity-body of the HTTP response using the application/json media type : . | error REQUIRED | A single ASCII error code. | invalid_request | The request is missing a required parameter, includes an unsupported parameter value (other than grant type), repeats a parameter, includes multiple credentials, utilizes more than one mechanism for authenticating the client, or is otherwise malformed. | . | invalid_client | Client authentication failed (e.g., unknown client, no client authentication included, or unsupported authentication method). | . | invalid_grant | The provided authorization grant (e.g., authorization code, resource owner credentials) is invalid, expired or does not match the redirection URI used in the authorization request. | . | unauthorized_client | The authenticated client is not authorized to use this authorization grant type. | . | unsupported_token_type | itsme® does not support the revocation of the presented access token. | . | . | error_description OPTIONAL | Human-readable text providing additional information, used to assist the developer in understanding the error that occurred. | . | state | The string value provided in the Authorization Request.

Beyond that, your application can ask for additional standard scopes values which map to sets of related claims are: profile email address phone eid | service REQUIRED | It indicates the itsme® service your application intends to use, e.g. service:TEST_code by replacing \"TEST_code\" with the service code generated during registration. | . | openid REQUIRED | It indicates that your application intends to use the OpenID Connect protocol to verify a user's identity by returning a sub claim which represents a unique identifier for the authenticated user. | . | profile OPTIONAL | Returns claims that represent basic profile information, specifically family_name, given_name, name, gender, locale, picture and birthdate.If requested, a value SHALL always be returned for the above claims except for the given_name claim which MAY NOT be returned if the user doesn't have any first name(s). | . | email OPTIONAL | Returns the email claim, which contains the user's email address, and email_verified, which is a boolean indicating whether the email address was verified by the user.If requested, a value SHALL always be returned for the email_verified claim only if email claim is filled with a value, whereas the email claim SHALL always be returned only if the user gave us an email address. | . | address OPTIONAL | Returns user's postal address, represented as JSON Object containing some or all of these members formatted street_address postal_code localityIf requested, a value SHALL always be returned for users with a Belgian ID document, and SHALL NOT be returned for users with a Dutch ID documents. | . | phone OPTIONAL | Returns the phone_number claim, which contains the user's phone number, and phone_number_verified, which is a boolean indicating whether the phone number was verified by the user.If requested, a value SHALL always be returned for the above claims. | . | eid OPTIONAL | Returns the http://itsme.services/v2/claim/BENationalNumbe claim, which contains the unique identification number of natural persons who are registered in Belgium, and http://itsme.services/v2/claim/BEeidSn, which is a string indicating the Belgian ID card number.If requested, a value SHALL always be returned for the above claims. | . | . | redirect_uri REQUIRED | It is the URL to which users are redirected once the authentication is complete. The following restrictions apply to redirect URIs: The redirect URI MUST match the value preregistered during the registration. The redirect URI MUST begin with the scheme https (refer to this section for more information). There is an exception for localhost redirect URIs that are only permitted for development purposes, it’s not for use in production. The redirect URI SHALL NOT be a custom URL. The fragment identifier introduced by a hash mark # SHALL NOT be used. The redirect URI is case-sensitive. Its case MUST match the case of the URL path of your running application. For example, if your application includes as part of its path .../abc/response-oidc, do not specify .../ABC/response-oidc in the redirect URI. Because the web browser treats paths as case-sensitive, cookies associated with .../abc/response-oidc MAY be excluded if redirected to the case-mismatched .../ABC/response-oidc URL. If relevant (in case you have a mobile app) make sure that your redirect URIs support the Universal links and App links mechanism. Functionally, it will allow you to have only one single link that will either open your desktop web application, your mobile app or your mobile site on the User’s device. Universal links and App links are standard web links (http://mydomain.com) that point to both a web page and a piece of content inside an app. When a Universal Link is opened, the app OS checks to see if any installed app is registered for that domain. If so, the app is launched immediately without ever loading the web page. If not, the web URL is loaded into the webbrowser. | . | state Strongly RECOMMENDED | Specifies any string value that your application uses to maintain state between your Authorization Request and the Authorization Server's response.

When implementing the Identification service, you MUST at least specify one user claim in the scope parameter - profile email address ... - or in the claims parameter - name birthdatehttp://itsme.services/v2/claim/claim_citizenship. Parameters . | client_id REQUIRED | It identifies your application. This parameter value is generated during registration. | . | response_type REQUIRED | This defines the processing flow to be used when forming the response. Because itsme® supports the Authorization Code Flow, this value MUST be code. | . | scope REQUIRED | It allows your application to express the desired scope of the access request. Each scope returns a set of user attributes. The scopes an application should request depend on which user attributes your application needs. Once the user authorizes the requested scopes, his details are returned in an ID Token and are also available through the UserInfo Endpoint.All scope values must be space-separated.The basic (and required) scopes are openid and service. Beyond that, your application can ask for additional standard scopes values which map to sets of related claims are: profile email address phone eid | service REQUIRED | It indicates the itsme® service your application intends to use, e.g. service:TEST_code by replacing \"TEST_code\" with the service code generated during registration. | . | openid REQUIRED | It indicates that your application intends to use the OpenID Connect protocol to verify a user's identity by returning a sub claim which represents a unique identifier for the authenticated user. | . | profile OPTIONAL | Returns claims that represent basic profile information, specifically family_name, given_name, name, gender, locale, picture and birthdate.If requested, a value SHALL always be returned for the above claims except for the given_name claim which MAY NOT be returned if the user doesn't have any first name(s). | . | email OPTIONAL | Returns the email claim, which contains the user's email address, and email_verified, which is a boolean indicating whether the email address was verified by the user.If requested, a value SHALL always be returned for the email_verified claim only if email claim is filled with a value, whereas the email claim SHALL always be returned only if the user gave us an email address. | . | address OPTIONAL | Returns user's postal address, represented as JSON Object containing some or all of these members formatted street_address postal_code localityIf requested, a value SHALL always be returned for users with a Belgian ID document, and SHALL NOT be returned for users with a Dutch ID documents. | . | phone OPTIONAL | Returns the phone_number claim, which contains the user's phone number, and phone_number_verified, which is a boolean indicating whether the phone number was verified by the user.If requested, a value SHALL always be returned for the above claims. | . | eid OPTIONAL | Returns the http://itsme.services/v2/claim/BENationalNumbe claim, which contains the unique identification number of natural persons who are registered in Belgium, and http://itsme.services/v2/claim/BEeidSn, which is a string indicating the Belgian ID card number.If requested, a value SHALL always be returned for the above claims. | . | . | redirect_uri REQUIRED | It is the URL to which users are redirected once the authentication is complete.

The redirect URI MUST begin with the scheme https (refer to this section for more information). There is an exception for localhost redirect URIs that are only permitted for development purposes, it’s not for use in production. The redirect URI SHALL NOT be a custom URL. The fragment identifier introduced by a hash mark # SHALL NOT be used. The redirect URI is case-sensitive. Its case MUST match the case of the URL path of your running application. For example, if your application includes as part of its path .../abc/response-oidc, do not specify .../ABC/response-oidc in the redirect URI. Because the web browser treats paths as case-sensitive, cookies associated with .../abc/response-oidc MAY be excluded if redirected to the case-mismatched .../ABC/response-oidc URL. If relevant (in case you have a mobile app) make sure that your redirect URIs support the Universal links and App links mechanism. Functionally, it will allow you to have only one single link that will either open your desktop web application, your mobile app or your mobile site on the User’s device. Universal links and App links are standard web links (http://mydomain.com) that point to both a web page and a piece of content inside an app. When a Universal Link is opened, the app OS checks to see if any installed app is registered for that domain. If so, the app is launched immediately without ever loading the web page. If not, the web URL is loaded into the webbrowser. | . | state Strongly RECOMMENDED | Specifies any string value that your application uses to maintain state between your Authorization Request and the Authorization Server's response.

Azure AD B2C uses standards-based authentication protocols including OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and SAML. It integrates with most modern applications and commercial off-the-shelf software. You can configure Azure AD B2C to allow users to sign in to your application with credentials from itsme®, as we are supporting the OpenID Connect protocol. By integrating with us, you can offer your consumers the ability to sign in with their existing itsme® accounts, without having to create a new account just for your application. On the sign-up or sign-in page, Azure AD B2C presents a list of external identity providers the user can choose for sign-in. Once they select one of the external identity providers, itsme® for example, they’re redirected to the itsme® to complete the sign in process. After the user successfully signs in, they’re returned to Azure AD B2C for authentication of the account in your application. ",

    "content": "This section relates to the step 9 of the sequence diagram. In order to intiate the Sign session, you will forge a POST request towards this endpoint: BASE_URL/qes-partners/1.0.0/sign_document. Please note we are using SSLMA as authentication method, combined with IP filtering, as specified in SSLMA Authentication. Please note the same endpoint is used for starting the sign session and for requesting the status of this session (also see ‘requesting the session status’). Below you will find the mandatory and optional parameters to integrate in the HTTPS POST request body formatted as application/json: . | inDocs object REQUIRED | This contains the element(s) to be signed. | . | docHash array REQUIRED | This parameter MUST contain information related to the document(s) to be signed by itsme®, expressed as an array. | . | id string REQUIRED | This is the ID of the hash(es) to be signed. | . | di array of objects REQUIRED | This parameter MUST contain the hash(es) to be signed and their algorithm(s), expressed as an array. | . | alg string REQUIRED | This MUST be \"http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#sha256\", as only the SHA256 algorithm is supported. See http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#sha256 for more information. | . | value string REQUIRED | This is the hash to be signed during the signature flow. The value of the computed hash must be Base64 encoded. | . | reqID string REQUIRED | This is an ID you generate to identify the current request. | . | asyncRespID string OPTIONAL | This parameter MUST be set to 'null' in order to initiate the sign session. | . | optInp object REQUIRED | Those are additional information needed for the signature request. | . | lang string OPTIONAL | This parameters defines the recommended language to be used for GUI interaction. If not defined, then the language comes from a dedicated cookie. If no cookie, defaults to the browser language. | . | itsme object REQUIRED | This parameter contains all the information related to itsme® context. | . | signer object REQUIRED | This is all the information that allows identification of the User in itsme®. | . | userCode string REQUIRED | The identifier for the User as returned in step 6 | . | partnerCode string REQUIRED | This MUST be the client identifier you received when registering your application during the onboarding process. This parameter will be translated to a label describing the 3rd party for which the User is signing the document. | . | serviceCode string REQUIRED | It MUST contain the value of the serviceCode defined for your application during the onboarding process. | . | description array of objects OPTIONAL | Is a text you provide as the description of the document. The maximum length is 50 characters. It will be displayed in the itsme App. If providing a description, you MUST provide a value for each language supported by itsme ('en', 'fr', 'nl' and 'de'). Please see Supported character set for encoding concerns. | . | lang string REQUIRED | The language of this description. MUST be one of 'en', 'fr', 'nl' or 'de'. | . | value string REQUIRED | The description of the document in the above defined language. | . | redirectUrl string REQUIRED | This is the URL to which the User will be redirected (your remote SCA). This MUST exactly match the redirect URL of the specified service defined when registering your application during the onboarding process. | . | signPolicy object OPTIONAL | This is the object of the Signature policy to be used during the Signature. This parameter contains all the information related to the signature policy. | . | signPolicyRef string REQUIRED | Defines the reference of the signature policy to be used during itsme® Signing flow. In case no specific signature policy is applicable for that specific use case, the itsme® generic qualified signature policy SHOULD be used. The signature policy has to be indicated in the SCA Front-End to the User. The list of available codes can be retrieved from the JSON document.The signature policies used SHOULD be defined during the onboarding process. It is up to you to choose your signature policies within the list given by itsme®. If you want to add new signature policies to your list, please ask the itsme® Onboarding team. | . | commitmentTypeRef string OPTIONAL | Defines the reference of the commitment type to be used during itsme® Signing flow. This parameter is used to display (in the itsme® App) the commitment type of the signature to the User. There is no commitment type by default. If the parameter is not given by the SCA, then nothing is displayed in the itsme® App. You SHOULD use a code that corresponds to a specific commitment type. The list of available codes can be retrieved from the JSON document.The commitment types used SHOULD be defined during the onboarding process. It is up to you to choose your commitment types within the list given by itsme®. If you want to add new commitment types to your list, please ask the itsme® Onboarding team. | . | signerRole array of objects OPTIONAL | Defines the role of the signer. This information is displayed in the itsme® App to show to the signer under which role he will sign the document. If no signer role is provided nothing will be displayed in the itsme® App. This parameter is optional and freely defined in a free text of maximum 50 characters by yourself. You SHOULD provide this free text in all supported languages ('en', 'fr', 'nl' and 'de'). The characters used to define the Signer Role MUST be ISO-8859-1 compatible. | . | lang string REQUIRED | The language of this role description. MUST be one of 'en', 'fr', 'nl' or 'de'. | . | value string REQUIRED | The role description of the signer in the above defined language. | . Example: .

You must do that by forging a GET request towards the url specified at previous step, in the parameter signingUrl. Please note we can only whitelist one URL per serviceCode. As a result, the signingUrl will in practice be the same as the identificationUrl. Please note there is no built-in parameter designed to let you getting your session context back after the redirection to your FE (a parameter similar to the ‘state’ parameter in OpenID). However, you MAY add any query parameter to the URL specified in signingUrl and it will be preserved during the redirection, effectively allowing you to craft a custom parameter for finding back your session context. Also, please note that the duration of the identification process may strongly vary from a few seconds to a few minutes, depending on whether or not we need to create a certificate for this end user.
