It allows you to verify the identity of an end-user based on the authentication performed by an authorization server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the end-user. The diagram below describes the Authentication process and how your systems will be interacting with itsme® : . To get to this result please make sure you . | add itsme® button to your front-end page so the user can indicate he wishes to authenticate with itsme® : itsme® button specifications. | create the Authorization Request to authenticate the User. This request will redirect the user to the itsme® app. itsme® will then authenticates the user by asking him . | to enter his phone number on the itsme® sign-in page | authorize the release of some information to your application | to provide his credentials (itsme® code, fingerprint or FaceID) | . It is also in this Authorization Request that you will be able to request claims about the user and the Authentication event. | collect the Authorization Code once the user has been authenticated and redirected by itsme® to your mobile or web application. | exchange the Authorization Code for an ID token (e.g. identifying the user) and an Access Token. | Obtain the additional claims by presenting the access token to the itsme® UserInfo Endpoint if the required claims are not returned in the ID token. | Confirm the success of the operation and display a success message. | .

    "content": "itsme® supports the following authentication methods to protect the exchange of sensitive information and ensure the requested information gets issued to a legitimate application and not some other party : . | asymmetric RSA key pair | symmetric shared secret | . itsme® recommend using the asymmetric RSA key pair method and allow you to rotate your keys without the need to sync with us. Asymmetric RSA . This method requires that each party exposes its public keys as a simple JWK Set document on a URI publicly accessible, and keep its private keys for itself. For itsme®, this URI can be retrieved from the itsme® Discovery document, using the “jwks_uri” key. Your private and public keys can be generated using your own tool or via Yeoman. If using Yeoman, you need to install generator-itsme with NPM: . $ npm install -g yo generator-itsme . After installation, run the generator: . $ yo itsme . The Yeoman tool will generate two files, the jwks_private.json which MUST be stored securely in your system, and the jwks_public.json which needs to be exposed as a JWK Set on a URI publicly accessible and have the HTTPS scheme. Whatever the tool you are choosing to create your key pairs, don't forget to send your JWK Set URI by email to onboarding@itsme.be and itsme® will make sure to complete the configuration for you in no time! Symmetric secret . This method requires the exchange of a static secret that will be used to authenticate with our Back-End. The client_secret value will be provided by itsme® when registering your project. ",

    "title": "Mapping the user",
    "content": "To sign in successfully in your web desktop, mobile web or mobile application, a given user must be mapped to a user account in your database. By default, your application Server will use the subject identifier, or sub claim, in the ID Token to identify and verify a user account. The sub claim is a string that uniquely identifies a given user account. The benefit of using a sub claim is that it will not change, even if other user attributes (email, phone number, etc) associated with that account are updated. The sub claim value must be mapped to the corresponding user in your application Server. If no user record is storing the sub claim value, then you should allow the user to associate his new or existing account to the sub. All these flows are depicted in the itsme® B2B portal. In a limited number of cases (e.g. technical issue,…) a user could ask itsme® to ‘delete’ his account. As a result the specific account will be ‘archived’ (for compliancy reasons) and thus also the unique identifier(s) (e.g. “sub”). If the same user would opt to re-create an itsme® afterwards, he will need to re-bind his itsme® account with your application server, in the same way as for the initial binding. After successful re-binding you will need to overwrite the initial reference with the new sub claim value in your database. ",

Because itsme® supports the Authorization Code Flow, this value MUST be code. | . | scopeREQUIRED | It allows your application to express the desired scope of the access request. Each scope returns a set of user attributes. The scopes an application should request depend on which user attributes your application needs. Once the user authorizes the requested scopes, his details are returned in an ID Token and are also available through the UserInfo Endpoint.All scope values must be space-separated.The basic (and required) scopes are openid and service. Beyond that, your application can ask for additional standard scopes values which map to sets of related claims are: profile email address phone | serviceREQUIRED | It indicates the itsme® service your application intends to use, e.g. service:TEST_code by replacing \"TEST_code\" with the service code generated during registration. | . | openidREQUIRED | It indicates that your application intends to use the OpenID Connect protocol to verify a user's identity by returning a sub claim which represents a unique identifier for the authenticated user. | . | profileOPTIONAL | Returns claims that represent basic profile information, specifically family_name, given_name, name, gender and birthdate. | . | emailOPTIONAL | Returns the email claim, which contains the user's email address, and email_verified, which is a boolean indicating whether the email address was verified by the user. | . | addressOPTIONAL | Returns the information about the user's postal address.

It MUST match the value preregistered during the registration and use the HTTPS scheme. http://localhost is only permitted for development purposes, it’s not for use in production.Note : if relevant (in case you have a mobile app) make sure that your redirect URIs support the Universal links and App links mechanism. Functionally, it will allow you to have only one single link that will either open your desktop web application, your mobile app or your mobile site on the User’s device. Universal links and App links are standard web links (http://mydomain.com) that point to both a web page and a piece of content inside an app. When a Universal Link is opened, the app OS checks to see if any installed app is registered for that domain. If so, the app is launched immediately without ever loading the web page.

The value is passed through unmodified from the Authentication Request to the ID Token. | . | login_hintOPTIONAL | If your application knows which user is trying to authenticate, it can use this parameter to pre-fill the phone number of the user on the itsme® sign-in page, e.g. 32+123456789 with 32 the country code and 123456789 the user's phone number. | . | ui_localesOPTIONAL | Indicates the user's preferred languages for the itsme® sign-in page, represented as a space-separated list of language tag values, ordered by preference.Possible values : fr nl de en | . | displayOPTIONAL | Specify how the itsme® sign-in page should be displayed to the user.
