    "title": "Securing the exchange of information",
    "content": "To protect the exchange of sensitive information and ensure the requested information gets issued to a legitimate application and not some other party, the OpenID Connect protocol uses JSON Web Token (JWT) which can be signed and/or encrypted. Among the methods described in OpenID specification, itsme® supports 2 authentication methods to secure communications between your backend and itsme®: . | \"Private key JWT\" is based on a public/private key pair (asymmetric encryption). It is therefore the most secure option | \"Client secret\" is based on a shared Secret key (symmetric encryption). It can be easier to implement in some cases | . You will have to choose between one of these methods when registering your project. Public-private key pair and JWKSet URI . This method uses a pair of keys (1 public, 1 private) to encrypt and decrypt senders’ and recipients’ sensitive data. It is also known as public-key cryptography or asymetric encryption. This method requires that each party exposes its public keys in the form of a JWK Set document on a publicly accessible URI, and keep its private keys for itself. You can retrieve the itsme® JWK Set from the URI mentioned as jwks_uri in our itsme® Discovery document. Refer to this page for more on signing and encrypting tokens. Whatever the tool you are choosing to create your key pairs, don't forget to send your JWK Set URI by email to onboarding@itsme-id.com and itsme® will make sure to complete the configuration for you in no time! The algorithms – needed to sign and encrypt a JWT – are listed in the itsme® Discovery document for more information. Secret key method . Secret key cryptography method uses the same secret key to encrypt and decrypt sensitive information. This approach is the inverse of public- and private-key encryption. This method requires the exchange of a static secret to be held by both the sender and the data receiver. The secret value will be provided by itsme® when registering your project. The algorithms – needed to sign and encrypt a JWT – are listed in the itsme® Discovery document for more information. If you choose to go with the secret key method, you will be able to specify if the ID Token JWT needs to be signed with the an asymmetric algorithm (e.g. RS256) or with a symmetric algorithm (e.g. : HS256). When using the RS256 algorithm, our public keys will be needed to verify the signature. This information can be found in our itsme® Discovery document, using the key jwks_uri. Key rotation procedure . for public-private key pair and JWKSet URI . itsme® backend has cache mechanism in place, which is sporadic (from 30min to 24h). During this time, we will keep on using old keys. use \"Cache-Control: max-age=\" HTTP header (min 30min) to lower waiting time. Rotating signing key: . | Add the new key to JWK set, with a new “kid” | Start using the new key to sign JWTs | When the flow is validated with the new key, remove the old one from the JWK set | . Rotating encryption key: . | Replace the old key with the new one in JWK set, but still support old and new keys in decryption process | Wait 24h (or wait for “max-age” amount of time, if specified) | Decommission the old key completely | . Changing the key could come along with changing the jwkset url. If that is the case, communicate new available jwkset url to onboarding@itsme-id.com. It is not be possible to be perfectly in sync, a few failed flows should be expected in the lapse of time between jwkset url update and the key update at the partner’s side. Smoother way would be: . | Copy the old jwkSet on the new URL | the URL is communicated &amp; registered by itsme® | Rotate the keys in the jwkSet on the new URL as per rotating keys info above | . for secret key method . Please, reach out to onboarding@itsme-id.com in case the secret key should be rotated. PKCE-enhanced flow . Whatever the chosen authentication method, itsme® also supports an extra security extension named Proof of Key for Code Exchange (PKCE). This additionnal layer of security is intended to mitigate some Authorization Code interception attacks. For this mechanism to achieve its full potential, PKCE has to be made mandatory in your flow, which is an option we can enable for you (strongly recommended). Please ask our onboarding team to do so when registering your project. If this option is not enabled, you are still free to use PKCE for some added security but requests without the PKCE code_challenge will be accepted as well at itsme® side. PKCE implies choosing a random string, named code_verifier, and then generating a SHA256 hash of that string, named code_challenge. The code_challenge has to be sent along with the Authorization Request, while the code_verifier must be sent with the Token Request, allowing our backend to make sure both requests are issued by the same source. code_verifier MUST contain only the unreserved characters [A-Z] / [a-z] / [0-9] / \"-\" / \".\" / \"_\" / \"~\", with a minimum length of 43 characters and a maximum length of 128 characters. code_challenge can then be obtained via this kind of instructions: . var hash = code_verifier.createHash('sha256'); var code_challenge = base64url.encode(hash); . Signing, encrypting and decoding JWTs . Libraries implementing JWT and the JOSE specs JWS, JWE, JWK, and JWA are listed here. For testing purposes only, we could advise the use of https://mkjwk.org/ for JWK generation and https://mkjose.org/ for payload check =&gt; these are 2 open-source tools which will help you visualize JWK mechanisms, client assertion construct. Please DO NOT generate production private keys on any website. Rather opt for the relevant SDK library mentioned here. ",

    "title": "Certificates and website security",
    "content": "itsme® requires https connections to guarantee security. With the https protocol, a web site operator obtains a certificate by applying to a certificate authority with a certificate signing request. The certificate request is an electronic document that contains the web site name, company information and the public key. The certificate provider signs the request, thus producing a public certificate. During web browsing, this public certificate is served to any web browser that connects to the web site and proves to the web browser that the provider believes it has issued a certificate to the owner of the web site. A certificate provider can opt to issue three types of certificates, each requiring its own degree of vetting rigor. In order of increasing rigor (and naturally, cost) they are: Domain Validation, Organization Validation and Extended Validation. The Domain Validation certificate doesn’t provide sufficient identity guarantees to itsme. So, only the Organization Validation and Extended Validation certificates are supported. For example, using the Let’s Encrypt open certificate authority is not suffcient because it only provide standard Domain Validation certificates. The chain of trust of these certificates need to be publicly accessible, meaning that our systems need to be able to access the root and the intermediate certificates. All itsme® API URL we publish use https. All requests to our endpoints MUST also use the SNI extension (refer to the RFC for more information) of the TLS protocol, that allows our servers to provide you with the correct certificate based on which endpoint you are querying.

If the request fails due to a missing, invalid, or mismatching redirection URI, or if the client identifier is missing or invalid,… the Authorization Endpoint will inform you of the error our itsme® sign-in page. If the User denies the access request or the User authentication fails, the Authorization Endpoint will inform you by adding the following parameters to the query component of the redirection URI using the application/x-www-form-urlencoded format : . | error REQUIRED | A single ASCII error code. | invalid_request | The request is missing a required parameter, includes an invalid parameter value, includes a parameter more than once, or is otherwise malformed. | . | access_denied | The User or the Authorization Endpoint denied the request. | . | login_required | The Authorization Endpoint requires User authentication.

Beyond that, your application can ask for additional standard scopes values which map to sets of related claims are: profile email address phone eid | service REQUIRED | It indicates the itsme® service your application intends to use, e.g. service:TEST_code by replacing \"TEST_code\" with the service code generated during registration. | . | openid REQUIRED | It indicates that your application intends to use the OpenID Connect protocol to verify a user's identity by returning a sub claim which represents a unique identifier for the authenticated user. | . | profile OPTIONAL | Returns claims that represent basic profile information, specifically family_name, given_name, name, gender, locale, picture and birthdate.If requested, a value SHALL always be returned for the above claims except for the given_name claim which MAY NOT be returned if the user doesn't have any first name(s). | . | email OPTIONAL | Returns the email claim, which contains the user's email address, and email_verified, which is a boolean indicating whether the email address was verified by the user.If requested, a value SHALL always be returned for the email_verified claim only if email claim is filled with a value, whereas the email claim SHALL always be returned only if the user gave us an email address. | . | address OPTIONAL | Returns user's postal address, represented as JSON Object containing some or all of these members formatted street_address postal_code localityIf requested, a value SHALL always be returned for users with a Belgian ID document, and SHALL NOT be returned for users with a Dutch ID documents. | . | phone OPTIONAL | Returns the phone_number claim, which contains the user's phone number, and phone_number_verified, which is a boolean indicating whether the phone number was verified by the user.If requested, a value SHALL always be returned for the above claims. | . | eid OPTIONAL | Returns the http://itsme.services/v2/claim/BENationalNumber claim, which contains the unique identification number of natural persons who are registered in Belgium, and http://itsme.services/v2/claim/BEeidSn, which is a string indicating the Belgian ID card number.If requested, a value SHALL always be returned for the above claims. | . | . | redirect_uri REQUIRED | It is the URL to which users are redirected once the authentication is complete. The following restrictions apply to redirect URIs: The redirect URI MUST match the value preregistered during the registration. The redirect URI MUST begin with the scheme https (refer to this section for more information). There is an exception for localhost redirect URIs that are only permitted for development purposes, it’s not for use in production. The redirect URI SHALL NOT be a custom URL. The fragment identifier introduced by a hash mark # SHALL NOT be used. The redirect URI is case-sensitive. Its case MUST match the case of the URL path of your running application. For example, if your application includes as part of its path .../abc/response-oidc, do not specify .../ABC/response-oidc in the redirect URI. Because the web browser treats paths as case-sensitive, cookies associated with .../abc/response-oidc MAY be excluded if redirected to the case-mismatched .../ABC/response-oidc URL. If relevant (in case you have a mobile app) make sure that your redirect URIs support the Universal links and App links mechanism. Functionally, it will allow you to have only one single link that will either open your desktop web application, your mobile app or your mobile site on the User’s device. Universal links and App links are standard web links (http://mydomain.com) that point to both a web page and a piece of content inside an app. When a Universal Link is opened, the app OS checks to see if any installed app is registered for that domain. If so, the app is launched immediately without ever loading the web page. If not, the web URL is loaded into the webbrowser. | . | state Strongly RECOMMENDED | Specifies any string value that your application uses to maintain state between your Authorization Request and the Authorization Server's response.

This method requires that each party exposes its public keys in the form of a JWK Set document on a publicly accessible URI, and keep its private keys for itself. You can retrieve the itsme® JWK Set from the URI mentioned as jwks_uri in our itsme® Discovery document. Refer to this page for more on signing and encrypting tokens. Whatever the tool you are choosing to create your key pairs, don't forget to send your JWK Set URI by email to onboarding@itsme-id.com and itsme® will make sure to complete the configuration for you in no time! The algorithms – needed to sign and encrypt a JWT – are listed in the itsme® Discovery document for more information. Secret key method . Secret key cryptography method uses the same secret key to encrypt and decrypt sensitive information. This approach is the inverse of public- and private-key encryption. This method requires the exchange of a static secret to be held by both the sender and the data receiver. The secret value will be provided by itsme® when registering your project. The algorithms – needed to sign and encrypt a JWT – are listed in the itsme® Discovery document for more information. If you choose to go with the secret key method, you will be able to specify if the ID Token JWT needs to be signed with the an asymmetric algorithm (e.g. RS256) or with a symmetric algorithm (e.g. : HS256). When using the RS256 algorithm, our public keys will be needed to verify the signature. This information can be found in our itsme® Discovery document, using the key jwks_uri. Key rotation procedure . for public-private key pair and JWKSet URI . itsme® backend has cache mechanism in place, which is sporadic (from 30min to 24h). During this time, we will keep on using old keys. use \"Cache-Control: max-age=\" HTTP header (min 30min) to lower waiting time. Rotating signing key: . | Add the new key to JWK set, with a new “kid” | Start using the new key to sign JWTs | When the flow is validated with the new key, remove the old one from the JWK set | . Rotating encryption key: . | Replace the old key with the new one in JWK set, but still support old and new keys in decryption process | Wait 24h (or wait for “max-age” amount of time, if specified) | Decommission the old key completely | . Changing the key could come along with changing the jwkset url. If that is the case, communicate new available jwkset url to onboarding@itsme-id.com. It is not be possible to be perfectly in sync, a few failed flows should be expected in the lapse of time between jwkset url update and the key update at the partner’s side. Smoother way would be: . | Copy the old jwkSet on the new URL | the URL is communicated &amp; registered by itsme® | Rotate the keys in the jwkSet on the new URL as per rotating keys info above | . for secret key method . Please, reach out to onboarding@itsme-id.com in case the secret key should be rotated. PKCE-enhanced flow . Whatever the chosen authentication method, itsme® also supports an extra security extension named Proof of Key for Code Exchange (PKCE). This additionnal layer of security is intended to mitigate some Authorization Code interception attacks. For this mechanism to achieve its full potential, PKCE has to be made mandatory in your flow, which is an option we can enable for you (strongly recommended). Please ask our onboarding team to do so when registering your project. If this option is not enabled, you are still free to use PKCE for some added security but requests without the PKCE code_challenge will be accepted as well at itsme® side. PKCE implies choosing a random string, named code_verifier, and then generating a SHA256 hash of that string, named code_challenge. The code_challenge has to be sent along with the Authorization Request, while the code_verifier must be sent with the Token Request, allowing our backend to make sure both requests are issued by the same source. code_verifier MUST contain only the unreserved characters [A-Z] / [a-z] / [0-9] / \"-\" / \".\" / \"_\" / \"~\", with a minimum length of 43 characters and a maximum length of 128 characters. code_challenge can then be obtained via this kind of instructions: . var hash = code_verifier.createHash('sha256'); var code_challenge = base64url.encode(hash); . Signing, encrypting and decoding JWTs . Libraries implementing JWT and the JOSE specs JWS, JWE, JWK, and JWA are listed here. For testing purposes only, we could advise the use of https://mkjwk.org/ for JWK generation and https://mkjose.org/ for payload check =&gt; these are 2 open-source tools which will help you visualize JWK mechanisms, client assertion construct. Please DO NOT generate production private keys on any website. Rather opt for the relevant SDK library mentioned here. ",

    "content": "itsme® requires https connections to guarantee security. With the https protocol, a web site operator obtains a certificate by applying to a certificate authority with a certificate signing request. The certificate request is an electronic document that contains the web site name, company information and the public key. The certificate provider signs the request, thus producing a public certificate. During web browsing, this public certificate is served to any web browser that connects to the web site and proves to the web browser that the provider believes it has issued a certificate to the owner of the web site. A certificate provider can opt to issue three types of certificates, each requiring its own degree of vetting rigor. In order of increasing rigor (and naturally, cost) they are: Domain Validation, Organization Validation and Extended Validation. The Domain Validation certificate doesn’t provide sufficient identity guarantees to itsme. So, only the Organization Validation and Extended Validation certificates are supported. For example, using the Let’s Encrypt open certificate authority is not suffcient because it only provide standard Domain Validation certificates. The chain of trust of these certificates need to be publicly accessible, meaning that our systems need to be able to access the root and the intermediate certificates. All itsme® API URL we publish use https. All requests to our endpoints MUST also use the SNI extension (refer to the RFC for more information) of the TLS protocol, that allows our servers to provide you with the correct certificate based on which endpoint you are querying.

The error responses . Things will sometimes go wrong. So, OpenID Connect defines a number of rules regarding the format of errors returned from our endpoints. Authorization Endpoint errors . If the request fails due to a missing, invalid, or mismatching redirection URI, or if the client identifier is missing or invalid,… the Authorization Endpoint will inform you of the error our itsme® sign-in page. If the User denies the access request or the User authentication fails, the Authorization Endpoint will inform you by adding the following parameters to the query component of the redirection URI using the application/x-www-form-urlencoded format : . | error REQUIRED | A single ASCII error code. | invalid_request | The request is missing a required parameter, includes an invalid parameter value, includes a parameter more than once, or is otherwise malformed. | . | access_denied | The User or the Authorization Endpoint denied the request. | . | login_required | The Authorization Endpoint requires User authentication. This error MAY be returned when the prompt parameter value in the Authorization Request is none | . | interaction_required | The Authorization Endpoint requires User interaction of some form to proceed. This error MAY be returned when the prompt parameter value in the Authorization Request is none, but the Autorization Request cannot be completed without displaying a user interface for User interaction. | . | unsupported_request | The request contains a not supported parameter. | . | invalid_client_id | The request contains an invalid client_id. | . | invalid_redirect_uri | The request contains an invalid redirect URI. | . | unsupported_grant_type | Grant type not supported. | . | invalid_grant | Invalid grant. | . | invalid_scope | The requested scope is invalid, unknown, or malformed. | . | unsupported_display | Only page is supported. | . | unauthorized_client | Unknown or unspecified client_id. | . | unsupported_response_type | The Authorization Endpoint does not support obtaining an authorization code using this method. | . | invalid_request_object | The request parameter contains an invalid Request Object. | . | invalid_request_uri | The request_uri in the Authorization Request returns an error or contains invalid data. | . | invalid_request | Oauth2 parameters do not match Request object. | . | temporary_unavailable | The authorization server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overloading or maintenance of the server. | . | . | error_description OPTIONAL | Human-readable text providing additional information, used to assist the developer in understanding the error that occurred. | . | state | The string value provided in the Authorization Request.

The following restrictions apply to redirect URIs: The redirect URI MUST match the value preregistered during the registration. The redirect URI MUST begin with the scheme https (refer to this section for more information). There is an exception for localhost redirect URIs that are only permitted for development purposes, it’s not for use in production. The redirect URI SHALL NOT be a custom URL. The fragment identifier introduced by a hash mark # SHALL NOT be used. The redirect URI is case-sensitive. Its case MUST match the case of the URL path of your running application. For example, if your application includes as part of its path .../abc/response-oidc, do not specify .../ABC/response-oidc in the redirect URI. Because the web browser treats paths as case-sensitive, cookies associated with .../abc/response-oidc MAY be excluded if redirected to the case-mismatched .../ABC/response-oidc URL.

Functionally, it will allow you to have only one single link that will either open your desktop web application, your mobile app or your mobile site on the User’s device. Universal links and App links are standard web links (http://mydomain.com) that point to both a web page and a piece of content inside an app. When a Universal Link is opened, the app OS checks to see if any installed app is registered for that domain. If so, the app is launched immediately without ever loading the web page.

Parameters . | client_id REQUIRED | It identifies your application. This parameter value is generated during registration. | . | response_type REQUIRED | This defines the processing flow to be used when forming the response. Because itsme® supports the Authorization Code Flow, this value MUST be code. | . | scope REQUIRED | It allows your application to express the desired scope of the access request. Each scope returns a set of user attributes. The scopes an application should request depend on which user attributes your application needs. Once the user authorizes the requested scopes, his details are returned in an ID Token and are also available through the UserInfo Endpoint.All scope values must be space-separated.The basic (and required) scopes are openid and service. Beyond that, your application can ask for additional standard scopes values which map to sets of related claims are: profile email address phone eid | service REQUIRED | It indicates the itsme® service your application intends to use, e.g. service:TEST_code by replacing \"TEST_code\" with the service code generated during registration. | . | openid REQUIRED | It indicates that your application intends to use the OpenID Connect protocol to verify a user's identity by returning a sub claim which represents a unique identifier for the authenticated user. | . | profile OPTIONAL | Returns claims that represent basic profile information, specifically family_name, given_name, name, gender, locale, picture and birthdate.If requested, a value SHALL always be returned for the above claims except for the given_name claim which MAY NOT be returned if the user doesn't have any first name(s). | . | email OPTIONAL | Returns the email claim, which contains the user's email address, and email_verified, which is a boolean indicating whether the email address was verified by the user.If requested, a value SHALL always be returned for the email_verified claim only if email claim is filled with a value, whereas the email claim SHALL always be returned only if the user gave us an email address. | . | address OPTIONAL | Returns user's postal address, represented as JSON Object containing some or all of these members formatted street_address postal_code localityIf requested, a value SHALL always be returned for users with a Belgian ID document, and SHALL NOT be returned for users with a Dutch ID documents. | . | phone OPTIONAL | Returns the phone_number claim, which contains the user's phone number, and phone_number_verified, which is a boolean indicating whether the phone number was verified by the user.If requested, a value SHALL always be returned for the above claims. | . | eid OPTIONAL | Returns the http://itsme.services/v2/claim/BENationalNumber claim, which contains the unique identification number of natural persons who are registered in Belgium, and http://itsme.services/v2/claim/BEeidSn, which is a string indicating the Belgian ID card number.If requested, a value SHALL always be returned for the above claims. | . | . | redirect_uri REQUIRED | It is the URL to which users are redirected once the authentication is complete.

There is an exception for localhost redirect URIs that are only permitted for development purposes, it’s not for use in production. The redirect URI SHALL NOT be a custom URL. The fragment identifier introduced by a hash mark # SHALL NOT be used. The redirect URI is case-sensitive. Its case MUST match the case of the URL path of your running application. For example, if your application includes as part of its path .../abc/response-oidc, do not specify .../ABC/response-oidc in the redirect URI. Because the web browser treats paths as case-sensitive, cookies associated with .../abc/response-oidc MAY be excluded if redirected to the case-mismatched .../ABC/response-oidc URL. If relevant (in case you have a mobile app) make sure that your redirect URIs support the Universal links and App links mechanism. Functionally, it will allow you to have only one single link that will either open your desktop web application, your mobile app or your mobile site on the User’s device. Universal links and App links are standard web links (http://mydomain.com) that point to both a web page and a piece of content inside an app. When a Universal Link is opened, the app OS checks to see if any installed app is registered for that domain. If so, the app is launched immediately without ever loading the web page. If not, the web URL is loaded into the webbrowser. | . | state Strongly RECOMMENDED | Specifies any string value that your application uses to maintain state between your Authorization Request and the Authorization Server's response. You can use this parameter for several purposes, such as directing the user to the correct resource in your application and mitigating cross-site request forgery. | . | nonce Strongly RECOMMENDED | A string value used to associate a session with an ID Token, and to mitigate replay attacks.

If the display parameter is not specified, this is the default display mode. | . | acr_values OPTIONAL | Indicates the authentication method required to process the request, represented as a space-separated list of tag values, ordered by preference.Possible values : http://itsme.services/v2/claim/acr_basic http://itsme.services/v2/claim/acr_advancedNote : if these two values are provided only the most constraining authentication method will be applied, e.g. http://itsme.services/v2/claim/acr_advanced. | http://itsme.services/v2/claim/acr_basic | It lets the user to choose either fingerprint usage (if device is compatible) or itsme® code. If the acr_values parameter is not specified, this is the default authentication method. | . | http://itsme.services/v2/claim/acr_advanced | It forces the user to use his itsme® code. | . | . | claims OPTIONAL | Allows to request specific user's details (\"claims\"). You can choose to receive those claims either in the ID Token (from /token endpoint) or in the UserInfo object (from /userinfo endpoint).It MUST be a JSON object containing an {\"id_token\":{...}} member or a {\"userinfo\":{...}} member respectively. This member will then contain all the desired claims together with indication whether the claim is voluntary (returned if available) or essential (flow will stop if unavailable) - see example below.Note: to avoid the need of a /userinfo request, itsme® recommends to retrieve the claims directly from the ID Token.When implementing the Confirmation service, you MUST use a WYSIWYS template to pre-structure the transaction screen in the itsme® app (refer to this section for more information).Supported claims are listed below. | name OPTIONAL | Returns user's full name in displayable form including all name parts, possibly including titles and suffixes.If requested, a value SHALL always be returned for this claim. | . | given_name OPTIONAL | Returns user's given name(s) or first name(s).

It MUST match the value used in the Authorization Request. | . | code_verifier OPTIONAL | High-entropy cryptographic random string using the unreserved characters [A-Z] / [a-z] / [0-9] / \"-\" / \".\" / \"_\" / \"~\", with a minimum length of 43 characters and a maximum length of 128 characters. This parameter is REQUIRED if you required PKCE to be enforced. | . | client_assertion_type REQUIRED | Specifies the type of assertion. Set this to urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer. | . | client_assertion REQUIRED | Is a set of identity and security information, in the form of a JWT, used as an authentication method. To ensures that the request to get the id token and access token is made only from your application, and not from a potential attacker that may have intercepted the authorization code, the JWT MUST be signed, and MAY also be encrypted. If both signing and encryption are performed, it MUST be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT (refer to this page for more information).The JWT contains the following claims. | iss REQUIRED | The issuer of the token. This value MUST be the same as the client_id. | . | sub REQUIRED | The subject of the token. This value MUST be the same as the client_id. | . | aud REQUIRED | The full URL of the resource you're using the JWT to authenticate to. Set this to https://idp.[e2e/prd].itsme.services/v2/token. | . | jti REQUIRED | An unique identifier for the token, containing maximum 255 characters. | . | exp REQUIRED | The expiration time of the token in seconds since January 1, 1970 UTC. | . | iat OPTIONAL | The time at which the JWT was issued. | . | . Response . 200 application/json . | access_token | Allows an application to retrieve consented user information from the UserInfo Endpoint. | . | token_type | Provides your application with the information required to successfully utilize the access token. Returned value is Bearer.. | . | id_token | A security token that contains information about the authentication of an user, and potentially other requested claim data's. The id_token value is represented as a signed and encrypted JWT. So, before being able to use the ID Token claims you will have to decrypt and verify the signature (refer to this page for more information). | . | POST https://oidc.[e2e/prd].itsme.services/clientsecret-oidc/csapi/v0.1/connect/token . To assert the identity of the user, the code received previously needs to be exchanged for an ID token and access token. During this step, your application has to authenticate itself to our server using the secret key method. The parameters below must be included in the body of the POST request, not in the query string. Parameters . | grant_type REQUIRED | Set this to authorization_code to tell the Token Endpoint that your application wants to exchange an authorization code for an ID koken and access token. | . | client_id REQUIRED | It identifies your application. This parameter value is generated during registration. | . | code REQUIRED | The intermediate opaque credential received in the Authorization Response. | . | redirect_uri REQUIRED | It is the URL to which users are redirected once the authentication is complete. It MUST match the value used in the Authorization Request. | . | client_secret REQUIRED | Contains the a key you reveiced when registering your application. This ensures that the request to get the id token and access token is made only from your application, and not from a potential attacker that may have intercepted the authorization code. | . | code_verifier OPTIONAL | High-entropy cryptographic random string using the unreserved characters [A-Z] / [a-z] / [0-9] / \"-\" / \".\" / \"_\" / \"~\", with a minimum length of 43 characters and a maximum length of 128 characters. This parameter is REQUIRED if you required PKCE to be enforced. | . Response . 200 application/json . | access_token | Allows an application to retrieve consented user information from the UserInfo Endpoint. | . | token_type | Provides your application with the information required to successfully utilize the access token. Returned value is Bearer. | . | id_token | A security token that contains information about the authentication of an user, and potentially other requested claim data's. The id_token value is represented as a signed and encrypted JWT. So, before being able to use the ID Token claims you will have to decrypt and verify the signature (refer to this page for more information). | . | .

    "title": "Securing the exchange of information",
    "content": "To protect the exchange of sensitive information and ensure the requested information gets issued to a legitimate application and not some other party, the OpenID Connect protocol uses JSON Web Token (JWT) which can be signed and/or encrypted. Among the methods described in OpenID specification, itsme® supports 2 authentication methods to secure communications between your backend and itsme®: . | \"Private key JWT\" is based on a public/private key pair (asymmetric encryption). It is therefore the most secure option | \"Client secret\" is based on a shared Secret key (symmetric encryption). It can be easier to implement in some cases | . You will have to choose between one of these methods when registering your project. Public-private key pair and JWKSet URI . This method uses a pair of keys (1 public, 1 private) to encrypt and decrypt senders’ and recipients’ sensitive data. It is also known as public-key cryptography or asymetric encryption. This method requires that each party exposes its public keys in the form of a JWK Set document on a publicly accessible URI, and keep its private keys for itself. You can retrieve the itsme® JWK Set from the URI mentioned as jwks_uri in our itsme® Discovery document. Refer to this page for more on signing and encrypting tokens. Whatever the tool you are choosing to create your key pairs, don't forget to send your JWK Set URI by email to onboarding@itsme-id.com and itsme® will make sure to complete the configuration for you in no time! The algorithms – needed to sign and encrypt a JWT – are listed in the itsme® Discovery document for more information. Secret key method . Secret key cryptography method uses the same secret key to encrypt and decrypt sensitive information. This approach is the inverse of public- and private-key encryption. This method requires the exchange of a static secret to be held by both the sender and the data receiver. The secret value will be provided by itsme® when registering your project. The algorithms – needed to sign and encrypt a JWT – are listed in the itsme® Discovery document for more information. If you choose to go with the secret key method, you will be able to specify if the ID Token JWT needs to be signed with the an asymmetric algorithm (e.g. RS256) or with a symmetric algorithm (e.g. : HS256). When using the RS256 algorithm, our public keys will be needed to verify the signature. This information can be found in our itsme® Discovery document, using the key jwks_uri. Key rotation procedure . for public-private key pair and JWKSet URI . itsme® backend has cache mechanism in place, which is sporadic (from 30min to 24h). During this time, we will keep on using old keys. use \"Cache-Control: max-age=\" HTTP header (min 30min) to lower waiting time. Rotating signing key: . | Add the new key to JWK set, with a new “kid” | Start using the new key to sign JWTs | When the flow is validated with the new key, remove the old one from the JWK set | . Rotating encryption key: . | Replace the old key with the new one in JWK set, but still support old and new keys in decryption process | Wait 24h (or wait for “max-age” amount of time, if specified) | Decommission the old key completely | . Changing the key could come along with changing the jwkset url. If that is the case, communicate new available jwkset url to onboarding@itsme-id.com. It is not be possible to be perfectly in sync, a few failed flows should be expected in the lapse of time between jwkset url update and the key update at the partner’s side. Smoother way would be: . | Copy the old jwkSet on the new URL | the URL is communicated &amp; registered by itsme® | Rotate the keys in the jwkSet on the new URL as per rotating keys info above | . for secret key method . Please, reach out to onboarding@itsme-id.com in case the secret key should be rotated. PKCE-enhanced flow . Whatever the chosen authentication method, itsme® also supports an extra security extension named Proof of Key for Code Exchange (PKCE). This additionnal layer of security is intended to mitigate some Authorization Code interception attacks. For this mechanism to achieve its full potential, PKCE has to be made mandatory in your flow, which is an option we can enable for you (strongly recommended). Please ask our onboarding team to do so when registering your project. If this option is not enabled, you are still free to use PKCE for some added security but requests without the PKCE code_challenge will be accepted as well at itsme® side. PKCE implies choosing a random string, named code_verifier, and then generating a SHA256 hash of that string, named code_challenge. The code_challenge has to be sent along with the Authorization Request, while the code_verifier must be sent with the Token Request, allowing our backend to make sure both requests are issued by the same source. code_verifier MUST contain only the unreserved characters [A-Z] / [a-z] / [0-9] / \"-\" / \".\" / \"_\" / \"~\", with a minimum length of 43 characters and a maximum length of 128 characters. code_challenge can then be obtained via this kind of instructions: . var hash = code_verifier.createHash('sha256'); var code_challenge = base64url.encode(hash); . Signing, encrypting and decoding JWTs . Libraries implementing JWT and the JOSE specs JWS, JWE, JWK, and JWA are listed here. For testing purposes only, we could advise the use of https://mkjwk.org/ for JWK generation and https://mkjose.org/ for payload check =&gt; these are 2 open-source tools which will help you visualize JWK mechanisms, client assertion construct. Please DO NOT generate production private keys on any website. Rather opt for the relevant SDK library mentioned here. ",

    "title": "Certificates and website security",
    "content": "itsme® requires https connections to guarantee security. With the https protocol, a web site operator obtains a certificate by applying to a certificate authority with a certificate signing request. The certificate request is an electronic document that contains the web site name, company information and the public key. The certificate provider signs the request, thus producing a public certificate. During web browsing, this public certificate is served to any web browser that connects to the web site and proves to the web browser that the provider believes it has issued a certificate to the owner of the web site. A certificate provider can opt to issue three types of certificates, each requiring its own degree of vetting rigor. In order of increasing rigor (and naturally, cost) they are: Domain Validation, Organization Validation and Extended Validation. The Domain Validation certificate doesn’t provide sufficient identity guarantees to itsme. So, only the Organization Validation and Extended Validation certificates are supported. For example, using the Let’s Encrypt open certificate authority is not suffcient because it only provide standard Domain Validation certificates. The chain of trust of these certificates need to be publicly accessible, meaning that our systems need to be able to access the root and the intermediate certificates. All itsme® API URL we publish use https. All requests to our endpoints MUST also use the SNI extension (refer to the RFC for more information) of the TLS protocol, that allows our servers to provide you with the correct certificate based on which endpoint you are querying.

If the request fails due to a missing, invalid, or mismatching redirection URI, or if the client identifier is missing or invalid,… the Authorization Endpoint will inform you of the error our itsme® sign-in page. If the User denies the access request or the User authentication fails, the Authorization Endpoint will inform you by adding the following parameters to the query component of the redirection URI using the application/x-www-form-urlencoded format : . | error REQUIRED | A single ASCII error code. | invalid_request | The request is missing a required parameter, includes an invalid parameter value, includes a parameter more than once, or is otherwise malformed. | . | access_denied | The User or the Authorization Endpoint denied the request. | . | login_required | The Authorization Endpoint requires User authentication.

The following restrictions apply to redirect URIs: The redirect URI MUST match the value preregistered during the registration. The redirect URI MUST begin with the scheme https (refer to this section for more information). There is an exception for localhost redirect URIs that are only permitted for development purposes, it’s not for use in production. The redirect URI SHALL NOT be a custom URL. The fragment identifier introduced by a hash mark # SHALL NOT be used. The redirect URI is case-sensitive. Its case MUST match the case of the URL path of your running application. For example, if your application includes as part of its path .../abc/response-oidc, do not specify .../ABC/response-oidc in the redirect URI. Because the web browser treats paths as case-sensitive, cookies associated with .../abc/response-oidc MAY be excluded if redirected to the case-mismatched .../ABC/response-oidc URL. If relevant (in case you have a mobile app) make sure that your redirect URIs support the Universal links and App links mechanism. Functionally, it will allow you to have only one single link that will either open your desktop web application, your mobile app or your mobile site on the User’s device. Universal links and App links are standard web links (http://mydomain.com) that point to both a web page and a piece of content inside an app. When a Universal Link is opened, the app OS checks to see if any installed app is registered for that domain. If so, the app is launched immediately without ever loading the web page.

    "title": "Integrating itsme® on an IAM platform",
    "content": "Most IAM platforms allow for the usage of different Identity Providers (IdP), either as pre-configured partners or via standardized communication protocols to be configured with the right parameters. OpenId Connect is the most common of those protocols and the one that itsme® strictly adheres to, which means that itsme® can be used as an IdP on pretty much any IAM platform. However, depending on the way each platform implemented the protocol and on the configurability they offer, not all features of itsme® will always be available. In general, we outline 3 attention points: . 1) Type of service from itsme®: In general, only Identification and Authentication are available through an IAM platform. The Confirmation service from itsme® implies not only data communication from itsme® to the platform, but also communication from the platform to itsme® of the content to be confirmed. IAM platforms in general are not equipped for bi-directional communication. 2) Authentication Method: itsme® allows partners to authenticate via 2 of the authentication specified by OpenId Connect: private_key_jwt is the most secure way, relying on asymmetric cryptography, while client_secret_post relies on symmetric cryptography. Most platforms will only support integration with itsme® through the Client Secret option either because they don’t support private_key_jwt at all or because they have only basic support for it, not allowing signed and encrypted tokens at each step of the flow. 3) Available attributes: While itsme® offers a broad range of identity attributes for each user (called “claims” in OIDC), not all IAM platforms allow you to take advantage of all claims: . | OIDC makes use of the concept of “scopes”, regrouping a predefined set of claims. Some platforms only allow to request scopes, not individual claims, making it impossible to retrieve claims that are not part of a scope. | Most of our claims are returning a string value (“Name”:”John Smith”) but some are returning a structured JSON object, like address: {“street_adress”:”Station Street 34”, “postal_code”:”12345”}. Some platforms are only able to handle simple strings, not objects. | . Here is a table of all the itsme® claims with their respective scope (if any) and format.

While IEF will allow you to process the rest of ID Data listed above in data type string. User Flows . User flows is a portal (GUI) configurable flow, which is based on built-in user attributes (values collected on sign up) and application claims, which are values about the user, returned to the application in the token. One can create custom attributes, but Azure B2C does not process any claims from itsme®, except the ones mapped during general idp setup (idp claims mapping), i.e. sub, given_name, family_name, email. Only those were returned consistently during testing of 2023.

If the User has no signature certificate yet, the certificate creation process will be initiated automatically. | Finally, when the User is authenticated and has a signature certificate, he is redirected to the your SCA Front-End. The redirection to your SCA Front-End SHOULD be (almost) transparent to the User (with a possible displaying of a spinner) as the laps of time between step 5 and step 11 of this diagram SHOULD be extremely short. | Your SCA Back-End contacts the itsme® Integration Layer Back-End to get the signature certificate of the User. | The itsme® Integration Layer Back-End returns your SCA Back-End the signer information as well as the signature certificate of the User. | Your SCA Back-End constructs the data to be signed and the hash(es) of the signature(s) will be computed by yourself. We support up to 70 hashes in 1 flow. The value of a hash MUST be base64url encoded. | Your SCA Back-End will provide the hash(es) to the itsme® Integration Layer Back-End to request the digital signature value. | A session id and redirect URL are returned by itsme® to your SCA Back-End. | Your SCA frontend will then redirect the User to the signature webpage of itsme®, where he is guided through the itsme part of the signing flow. | The session of the User at itsme® side ends as the process is finished and the User is redirected to your SCA Front-End. | Your SCA Back-End will contact the itsme® Integration Layer Back-End to check the signature status (same endpoint as for creating the signature session). | itsme® then returns the signature completion status and the digital signature value(s). | At this stage, your SCA is able to confirm the success of the operation and display a success message. | .

This MUST exactly match the redirect URL of the specified service defined when registering your application during the onboarding process. | . | signPolicy object OPTIONAL | This is the object of the Signature policy to be used during the Signature. This parameter contains all the information related to the signature policy. | . | signPolicyRef string REQUIRED | Defines the reference of the signature policy to be used during itsme® Signing flow. In case no specific signature policy is applicable for that specific use case, the itsme® generic qualified signature policy SHOULD be used. The signature policy has to be indicated in the SCA Front-End to the User. The list of available codes can be retrieved from the JSON document.The signature policies used SHOULD be defined during the onboarding process. It is up to you to choose your signature policies within the list given by itsme®. If you want to add new signature policies to your list, please ask the itsme® Onboarding team. | . | commitmentTypeRef string OPTIONAL | Defines the reference of the commitment type to be used during itsme® Signing flow. This parameter is used to display (in the itsme® App) the commitment type of the signature to the User. There is no commitment type by default.

    "content": "The JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) framework consists of several technologies: . | JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure, as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure or enclosed in another JWE or JWS structure to create a Nested JWT, enabling nested signing and encryption to be performed. In fact a JWT does not exist itself — either it has to be a JWS and/or a JWE. It’s like an abstract class — the JWS and JWE are the concrete implementations. | JSON Web Signature (JWS) represents signed content using JSON data structures and base64url encoding as defined in the specifications. | JSON Web Encryption (JWE) specification standardizes the way to represent an encrypted content in a JSON-based data structure. | JSON Web Key (JWK) defines a consistent way to represent a cryptographic key in a JSON structure which is used to sign (JWS) and/or encrypt (JWE) a specific content. The JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) extension defines a consistent way to represent a set of cryptographic keys in a JSON structure. As itsme® only support the RSA cryptosystem, it requires that each party exposes its public keys as a simple JWK Set document on a URI accessible to all. | For itsme®, this URI can be retrieved from the itsme® Discovery document, using the \"jwks_uri\" key. | Your JWK Set document MUST be accessible via the URI communicated when setting up your project in the itsme® B2B portal or via email to onboarding@itsme-id.com. | . | .

So, you need to have/create your certificate key pairs (a key pair consists of a public key and a private key): you will need one pair for encryption and one pair for signing actions. You can use your certificates or (preferably) get them through a certificate authority. Next, you will need to ‘convert’ the PUBLIC keys (NOT the private key. You MUST keep the private key always private) to JWK and group them in a JWK Set. There are various tools that can be used and all major programming languages support have libraries available to do this for you. The resulting JWK Set MUST contain (at least) 2 JWK: one whereby the “use” parameter is ”enc” (for encryption) and another with “sig” (for signature). This JWK Set is nothing more than a plain text file (“JSON” format) and you should place that on a publicly available website under https schema (with EV/OV certificate) and share that link with us if you have no access to itsme® B2B portal yet.
