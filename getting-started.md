# Getting started

In order to start your integration we will first set-up your personal Sanbox environment. To do this you will be requested to provide the following information :  

<ul>
  <li>Contact details such as your email, name, phone number.</li>
  <li>Organisation details as shown on the company register for your jurisdiction.</li>
  <li>Information about the project you want to set-up (the services you want to use, the client authentication method you want to set-up, the user attributes you want to request, ...)</li>
</ul>

Our onboarding team will review your project and get in touch within 3 days with your credentials:
<ul>
  <li>a <i>"client_id"</i></li>
  <li>a <i>"service_code"</i></li>
  <li>information about your <a href="https://belgianmobileid.github.io/doc/getting-started.html#authentication" target="blank">client authentication method</a></li>
