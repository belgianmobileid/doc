# Getting started

In order to start your integration you will first need to setup your personal Sanbox environment. To do so, you will be requested to provide the following information :  

  - Contact details such as your email, name, phone number.
  - Organisation details as shown on the company register for your jurisdiction.
  - Information about the project you want to setup (the services you want to use, the client authentication method you want to set-up, the user attributes you want to request, ...).

Our onboarding team will review your project and get in touch with you in no time to provide your credentials :

  - a <i>"client_id"</i>
  - a <i>"service_code"</i>
  - information about your client authentication method
  - the list of user attributes you can request
