# 2. Prerequisite

Before you start integrating itsme®, you MUST create an organisation on the following url: <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdyfhKiiehNg4DhFzhQeHaj9EG2VeFoyPNVaI-TSwnG5WlFfw/viewform" target="blank">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdyfhKiiehNg4DhFzhQeHaj9EG2VeFoyPNVaI-TSwnG5WlFfw/viewform</a>.

Once there, you will need to fill out a basic form with the following questions:

<ul>
  <li>Contact details such as your email, name, phone number.</li>
  <li>Organisation details as shown on the company register for your jurisdiction.</li>
  <li>Information about the project you want to set-up and the use case you have in mind.</li>
  <li>itsme® terms and conditions. If you require a copy of this please contact onboarding@itsme.be.</li>
</ul>

Our onboarding team will review your project and get in touch within 3 days with a <i>"client_id"</i> and a <i>"service_code"</i> which need to be added in your configuration. Meanwhile, this should not prevent you from starting your integration.
